Atomic habit is one such insanely practical book which can be applied in life the moment you started reading this book. I remember a similar book I read a few years back 'The Power of Habit' by Charles Duhigg. I would say this book is a easier version than the power of habit book. Concepts are moreover similar in both the books. This book is just written in way so that it's easy to apply the learnings from the book of n daily life. The four key things for forming habits cue, craving, response, reward are discussed in detail in separate chapters. If you are looking for a great book on habit formation read this one first and then you can read 'The Power of Habit' book. Only thing I felt extra and not required is the last one or two chapters. The book could have been shorter. The reason I didn't rate it five star is because already another excellent book has been written on the similar topic by Charles Duhigg\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

After graduating from law school in 1980, he practiced for a few years. Feeling unhappy with his career in law, he became a motivational speaker which he felt was his true calling. The numerous examples of people who achieved their goals through positive attitude are from his personal experience and research\n\nWhat do I like about this book?\n- The overall motivational tone of the book, that creates a positive drive within yourself\n- To-the-point crisp writing, without being verbose at all (unlike some other books which keep reiterating the same points through multiple pages)\n- Powerful examples from history\n- Great quotes by famous men. It is just a treat to read all these famous words by eminent people.\n- The book justifies its title ‘Attitude is everything’ through its content.\n\nWhat I did not like about the book?\nWell, honestly, NOTHING. I’m usually critical of books if I find any flaws with the writing, or content, or engagement, but I didn’t find anything lacking in this one. Hence, the complete five stars. The book is beautifully written with meaningful content.\n\nThe book begins with a famous quote by Thomas Jefferson – “Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” In the first chapter, Jeff Keller talks about his own circumstances that led to his career change, finally becoming a motivational speaker. He mentions general problems faced by common people in their day to day lives and hence creates a bond with the reader.\n\nThe book is primarily divided into 3 parts and 12 lessons. Each part includes various lessons, which are thought-provoking. The basic message conveyed through these three parts and lessons is – “When you THINK, SPEAK, and ACT in ways that support your success, you’re firing on all cylinders and on the way to achieving phenomenal results in your life.”\n\nPART 1 – SUCCESS BEGINS IN THE MIND: THINKING\nIn this part, the author tries to teach us that success begins in the mind, and he focuses on the power of attitude and belief in shaping your destiny.\n\nLesson 1 – Your Attitude is your window to the world.\nAttitude is like a mental filter through which you experience the world around you. Some people see the world through a filter of optimism while others have a more pessimist outlook. A person with positive attitude thinks ‘I CAN’ while the others think ‘I CAN’T’. We all start off with a clean window when we are young, and as we grow old, life throws some dirt on the window (like criticism, ridicule from peers, rejections, disappointments), and we start doubting our capabilities, we start having negative outlook towards thinks, and we are not as confident as we used to be earlier. The advice given in the lesson is to wash our mental window, so we can control our mental attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his/her reactions to different things happening all around.\nOne of the many Examples cited – Dr. Viktor Frankl’s (Author of Man’s Search for Meaning – would recommend people to read this) experiences during concentration camp.\n\nLesson 2 – You are a human magnet.\nThe message of this lesson can be summed up in a single quote by Earl Nightingale – “We become what we think about.” Jeff states the idea of ‘dominant thought’. He says, your dominant thoughts rule the day. Your beliefs brought you to where you are today, and your thinking from this point forward will take you where you will be in the future. As human magnets, we have the power to attract success through our thoughts. If you think about positive things, positive outcomes, success – same shall follow. However, he rightly warns against the expectation of overnight success too.\n\nLesson 3 – Picture your way to success.\nThe author asks the readers to create mental movies in the mind, picturing things and milestones they wished to achieve. At the same time, we have to get rid of our old rubbish mental images, which remind us of failure, negativity, and disappointments.\nOne of the many Examples cited – Story of singer Celine Dion where she mentions that from the age of five, she had always imagined singing in front of houseful audience, receiving multiple awards and becoming a superstar. Another example quoted is of Jim Carrey, who wrote a post-dated cheque to himself for $10 Million, which acted as a source of inspiration for him.\n\nLesson 4 - Make A Commitment And You Will Move Mountains.\nJeff mentions the book ‘The ultimate secret to getting absolutely everything you want’ by Mike Hemaki. He says, the key to getting what you want is the ‘willingness to do whatever it takes’ to accomplish your goals. When you commit to something, positive events start happening, the whole universe conspires to make it happen.\nHe gives the example of Benjamin Roll who cleared the bar council exam in his 14th attempt at the age of 74! Another example cited is that of ‘Baldacci’ who became a writer, by learning the craft of writing, through sheer commitment.\n\nLesson 5 - Turn Your Problems Into Opportunities.\nWhenever something goes wrong, we start questioning ourselves, our circumstances and at times our luck. In such a situation, we have two choices – 1. Keep feeling miserable or 2. Learn a lesson from the problem and move on. A problem should be seen as an opportunity to learn, improve, and do something better next time. Adversity encourages us to make necessary changes in our life, tap our hidden potential. It teaches us to be grateful for the small things and helps us build self-esteem and confidence.\nAs Napolean said, “Every adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.”\n\nPART 2 – WATCH YOUR WORDS: SPEAKING\nIn this part, the author focuses on what we speak. What we say, directly shows how we think, and precedes our actions.\n\nLesson 6 – Your Worlds Blaze A Trails.\nThe author says that words have immense power. They can build your future, destroy opportunities or help maintain the status quo. Your choice of words defines your personality.\nAlways remember – Thoughts &gt; Words &gt; Beliefs &gt; Actions &gt; Results\nThe author cites an inspirational example of Kent Cullers, a scientist at NASA.\n\nLesson 7 – How are you?\nJeff says that this question is the most frequently asked questions to any person, and what reply a person gives to this question is extremely important. Now, a reply to this question can be – Positive, Mediocre or Negative. We should avoid negative answers as they drain the energy of others as well. Jeff says that we should always reply to this question with words such as ‘Terrific’ or ‘Great’ or other such positive words. This will help boost our confidence and create a positive outlook.\n\nLesson 8 – Stop complaining.\nNobody wants to hear about our pains and problems. As William Penn said, “the secret of happiness is to count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.” Jeff says that complaining is a major problem in all of us, whereas it doesn’t help anyone. It doesn’t help the person ranting about his problems, and definitely doesn’t help the listener who’s least interested in listening to someone else’s problems when he has plenty of his own. However, at the same time, the author clarifies that sharing your problems with your nearest ones, is different from complaining, and rightly so.\n\nPART 3 – HEAVEN HELPS THOSE WHO ACT: ACTION\nIn this part, the author emphasizes on the fact that without action, positive thoughts and words will not help you attain the level of success you aimed for.\n\nLesson 9 - Associate with Positive People.\nWe are the average of the people we spend our most time with. The people you hang out with define your outlook and future because they greatly influence our thoughts and life. Hence, it is very important to be in the company of positive people, who have definite goals for themselves. Hanging around folks with no ambition or goals, who imbibe negativity in you, will put you on the path of failure.\n\nLesson 10 - Confront Your Fears and Grow.\nThe path that leads to success is often filled with obstacles. The people who succeed, do so by overcoming these obstacles. If you want to achieve something, you have to get out of your ‘comfort zone’. You have to stretch yourself. Adopt a mindset that helps you acquire what you want. Remember, repetition is the key, like any other muscle. It will build up and encourage you to do something great.\n\nLesson 11 – Get out there and fail.\nWinston Churchill said, - “Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” In order to success someday, you must be willing to fail today. Successful people around the world are wise enough to know that success doesn’t come in one shot. You have pe persevere, fail again and again, learn from your failures, and work on it again with double enthusiasm.\nThe author cites an example of TV talk show host ‘Sally Jessy Raphael’, who was fired 18 times, couldn’t pay her credit card bills for 26 years, lived on food stamps, before finally making it big in the industry.\n\nLesson 12 - Networking That Gets Results.\nThis lesson shows the importance of teamwork. It shows, if you’re positive and ready to help people, people, in turn, will go out of their way to help you back. Some key points from this lesson –\n- Develop a win-win attitude.\n- Effectively participate in a group or organization.\n- Do not stop the flow of messages, you should keep in touch with your peers.\n- Become a good listener.\n- Congratulate people on for their accomplishment.\n- Make new friends in your field.\n- Do more for others, before expecting something in return.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best self-improvement books ever written. The content of this book far outweighs its price, and although I have provided the summary for a quick glance, you can still go ahead and pick the book for a quick read. There are many more powerful impactful examples cited throughout the book which make this one an interesting read. Recommended!\n\nFavorite Quotes from the book:\n- “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way…. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food, and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis, it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not the result of camp influences alone.”\n- “When you believe you can do something, you have the courage to move forward despite being afraid.”\n- “As adults, most of us become a lot more concerned about the opinions of others, often hesitating because people may laugh at us or criticize us. At the age of six, we knew we had to fall.”\n- “Whether you think you can—or think you can’t—you’re right!” – Henry Ford\n- “You see, when you change your attitude, sparks fly in the universe. You’re energized. You begin to see new possibilities. You move into action. You achieve extraordinary results. That’s why I say when you change your attitude, you change your life!”\n- “What the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.”\n- “They can because they think they can.” – Virgil\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

The binding of pages is not good. For the product I would give 2-3 out of 5. But as the heading suggests it's a book review\n\nLet's start with a fun fact. Do you know this book was published in 1999 when the world was worrying about the Y2K apocalypse, Jeff Keller wrote this gem of a book before entering the modern era of crazy 20th Century.\nAttitude is something which is never ever thought in books, it is something which an individual learns and adapts from his/her surroundings. Starting from family, teachers and friends, each and everyone in your life will influence and unknowingly manipulate your thoughts. What the author is trying to say in the book over a course of 12 well crafted chapters is that one has always control of his/her attitude so why not channelize the enter focus of attitude towards positivity and self belief so that we are able to perform to the maximum potential. What I loved about the book was the fact that there were these deep meaningful proverbs and motivational lines written throughout the book quoting famous people so that you read them and feel energized and motivated with same. The author is not afraid to share his story stating how painfully miserable and depressed he was working as a full time lawyer. Something most of us are going through in this state of life wondering is it worth to slog into the office just to realize that in the end it was certainly not worth it. The author has written the book in the most simplest of language and explained some beautiful concepts to change one's attitude from a pessimist to an optimist. Something I will try to implement personally in my life. All in all I would not write anything from the book and potray that I am englightened and changed after reading this book.\n\nWhat I would say is that, if you are exhausted from daily routine, just take a break from netflix, YouTube, hotstar and what not and read this book. It can do wonders for you and might change your life for good.\n",0,service,0,content,0,,,,

Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy.

Dale enabled me to perform an in-depth self evaluation. I was able to not only highlight the shortcomings but to rectify them as well. I'd suggest particularly all the introverts out there regardless of wherever you belong to read this book and follow the guidelines.\n\nOne drawback, I believe, was the inability to distinguish flattery from ""honest appreciation"" in cases where an individual is not worthy of praise. Another ordinary factor associated to this book is its title. This provides another instance of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" hypothesis.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

Rarely, right? No matter how good the person is, there will be something/someone who disagrees with them. Everyone's unique. It's natural to have differences in opinion. BUT what if there's a way to reduce this differences, this gap?\n\nThis book comes with answer to the questions we have on human nature and relations- be it in social or business environment. Do you face difficulty in dealing with other people? Do you often feel no matter how hard you try, you are unable to get any results? Are you seeking answers? If yes, give this book a shot.\n\nThe author has used simple language throughout the book. If you are new to non fiction, don't worry, you won't have trouble reading this one. (Yup!I'm a newbie)\nThings I loved about the book:\n1. Division of book - The book is divided into four parts. At the end of each part, a brief summary is given. This helps the reader to revise and recollect the points.\n\n2. Incidents - Throughout the book, the author illustrates examples of how people used various principles and what results it had. This way, a reader can grasp the idea easily.\n\nYou may come across concepts you already know, you may find answers you've been seeking. You may end up loving, liking or not liking(slim chance) this book.

WRONG! You cannot correlate what the man said on some other podium in some other context in some other land. That needs to be said. Dont draw such parallels. The nationalism of today is very different from that of what he talks about in this book.\nThe first 2/3rd portion of the book-Nationalism in Japan and America-were specifically said in context with the ongoing WW1 to both nations by the man and are simply utterly boring. He, and I am sorry for my rudeness here, doesn't speak practically or goes to the point in ANY way. I have seen Sadhguru come around to answering a question faster!\nThere is however some context of how the nationalism was back then in India (circa 1910-30).\nCrux of the book is totally inconclusive. You dont arrive at any clear observations from this book. All I can now say is that Tagore ji was an extremely humane person, completely like a sage would be, saying no to weapons and creating borders and what not. But I do know this, he despised Nationalism, imperialism to some extent, the extremists who wanted full freedom. You can seriously get more from the preface that thebook itself!\nMy advice: put your 100 rupees to better use.\nAmazon delivery was speedy and the product is neatly printed and was in excellent condition.\nThanks.\n",1,content,1,quality,0,service,0,,

She carries it everywhere with so much love and affection. There is this old shopkeeper Ram Bharosa who is eyeing this prized possession of the young girl of Garhwal. He tries to have his way and get the umbrella under his paws. Would he be successful?\n\nA simple and short story of kindness and humanity is The Blue Umbrella. In this classic novella, Ruskin paints a vivid image of Garhwal where the story is set. Binya exchanges her leopard’s claw pendant for the blue silk umbrella. And when she comes across the frenzied and despairing state of Ram Bharosa, she does the unimaginable. As she says that an umbrella is not everything. This displays her sensibility and humility. This act of hers opens the heart of the old shopkeeper and positivity flows in. In short, there is a mix of heroism and redemption in this sweet story which is an ideal read for kids but could be equally enjoyed by the adults.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

She wants it so much that she readily exchanges her lucky leopard's claw pendant for it. She carries the umbrella wherever she goes and always keeps it open. No one in the village has ever seen or possessed such a beautiful umbrella. They envy her for her precious possession. The most envious of them is Ram Bharosa, the shopkeeper who tries various means to own the blue umbrella.

It will boost your soul and spirits, fill your heart with longing and happiness &amp; will take you back to the time when life was simpler and fun.\n\nIt is a collection of 22 short stories told by Ajji to her grandchildren Raghu, Meenu,Anand, Krishna and their neighbourhood friends. The grandchildren come to their grandparents place during their summer vacations. Their grandparents house is away from the hustle-bustle of the city life; surrounded by greenery and open field. The children however are most excited about the stories that Ajji is going to tell them during their stay with her.\n\nThe stories told by the grandmother are short &amp; sweet moral stories. These stories deal on wide variety of topics such as importance of:\n📍 hard work &amp;honesty\n📍being down to earth, being helpful &amp; humble &amp; content &amp; loyal\n📍having presence of mind\n📍loving people unconditionally\nAll the stories will fill you up with hope and that feeling of content that you used to feel if your grandparents also told you stories.\n\nThe narration is very effective as you will be able to retain the stories for a long time. The tone is full of warmth. The book is woven in a way to make you feel nostalgic.The book brought back strong memories of my childhood when my brother &amp; me used to travel to my native place with our parents to meet our grandparents during summer &amp; winter breaks. Those memories were overwhelming. The smile that used to break on my Amma's &amp; Dadaji's face are images that I would cherish for my lifetime. It's a shame that I lost them so early.\n\n This was my first Sudha Murty book &amp; I am so glad that I picked up her book. It brought me out of my reading slump of 2 long months. It's a very sweet &amp; a humble book. Do give it a read. You will not at all be disappointed.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

Clason is an preeminent author best known for this version of 1926.Clason tackles the subject how people can clear deficits and what contributes to extraordinary wealth as opposed to life's desires.\nMost of us know it to be true. However, I don’t think I’m lying when I say that most of us also believe that we if we just try that much harder and develop our talent that much further, it will be enough to become wildly wealthy, despite bad or just mediocre beginnings.144 pages depicts the story of babylonians how they accumulated wealth,this book is sum of historical secrets of financial wisdom.Contrastingly,Clason portrayed parables which were translated 1000 years old.\nMATHON is my favourite character in entirety reading, yes he is because he was diligent approachable men.He provided honest advices to Rodan He started ""it's a kings gift"" (his advises)""Mathon smiled the smile of one whose soul is much rich with experience"" He carved his all advises with a practical example I'd like almost every character.\nClason's ancient rich text do trouble sometimes in reading however, I didn't stop in 1 day I finished.My favourite part when Dabasir motivated Tarkad by his history of becoming camel trader was all a suspense moment that I didn't consider will be changed to nothing but a lesson for Tarkad.Algamish was buyer for Arkad,he sold his advices in return was so strange and I really enjoyed that part of Arkad's success.\nStoryline made me eager to continue read. Story allover gripped and I admired Hadan Gula because he never abandoned his efforts to impress everyone he met.Text is all covered with thee thou,so and so although it troubled since, it is ancient subject I graspingly entertained.Nothing is difficult to understand every character is a mystery which opens itself at the ending of chapter exceptionally Arkad(hero)I admire his contribution towards his people.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

May Disappoint - Dependent on Reader's Expectation.,"\n The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.\n\nThe book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.\n\nThe chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.\n\nI was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.\n\nThe hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy. Bought it for INR 460 against MRP of INR 499.\n",0,content,0,quality,0,,,,

It talks about art of staying young while growing old, about relaxing, about not running behind materialistic things, how to improve your performance in daily routine and to stay focused.\n\nOne of the best lesson which I liked was how to be more anti fragile. It talked about creating more options, by devoting time in your passion, taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile.\n\nBefore reading this book I felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai, but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed. There were few things like proverbs, quotes and traditions from centritains which I found were not really required. There is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening.\n\nP. S . And seriously I wish I could learn sun salutation and other exercise by reading.\n\nOverall I will say it’s a easy, simple read for beginners for setting up small goals.\n\nOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.\n——-Japanese proverb\n\nBook starts with this proverb and this literally summarises the book.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

I mean just take a moment and observe it, the perfect shade of blue with white flowers. Simplicity at its best. This book has some sort of vibe, I still remember how I smiled when I opened the amazon parcel and found this bundle of positivity and happiness. The sheer pleasure of caressing its pages which is very different as compared to the regular pages of other novels, it gives you immense relief Idk how and why, but it does. Coming to the main content, the book starts by telling the meaning of Ikigai i.e.,purpose of your life, reason to get out of your bed every morning happily and how finding your Ikigai will lead to a long and happy life. The importance of society and a friendly neighbourhood is well put.The interviews of the Japanese Centenarians explains why they are the longest living human beings on this planet, they do the simple activities like gardening also with full enthusiasm, they aren’t spending their retirement resting on an arm chair instead they attend Karaoke nights, indulge in group activities, sell their produce in vegetable market and believe in eating simple and exercising.They live in present and enjoy every moment happily. Because being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present and those who surround us.'\n🦋\nOur Ikigai is different for all of us but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning. There is no perfect strategy of connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it. Like the author said “Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you”. The simplest things are often the most beautiful, and this book is the perfect example of this statement. ' Eat right, exercise, and do what makes you happy'...by following this motto, we can definitely find our 'ikagai', our reason to live.\n",0,quality,0,content,0,,,,

The book explains that every being has an Ikigai, a journey of self-discovery and it’s worth the search. Ikigai draws attention to the lifestyle of Japanese people showcasing how they lead an optimal healthy life, filled with happiness, and longevity. The main focus is on diet, daily activities and a sense of joy. It also includes wisdom from supercentenarians(above the age of 110) from all over the world.Every individual's Ikigai is different but the search is common.

There would be no sickness, or suffering ever!\n\nBut on a second note I think maybe there really are a thousand Secret Gardens already and only because it must be a secret, no one can tell. All we need is to believe in 'magic' to uncover them and make them burst forth with energy and spirit that it will become so hard not to live.\n\nThis book makes me believe there is magic, even as an adult - not of fairylands or elves but of a kind which can be made quite possible in today's world.

The Illustrations In This Book Are Black And White Which Actually Makes It Look Cool. As You Can See It's A Hardcover Book And The Cover Looks Really Pretty. The Secret Garden is a children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett first published as a book in 1911, after a version was published as an American magazine serial beginning in 1910. In the spirit of A Little Princess, this story recognises the characteristics we must prize most as human beings. The Secret Garden is a ""lovely"" story in every sense of the word. Primarily, it's about three kids: Mistress Mary, Dickon, and Master Colin--and how just thinking a little differently can change a person completely.

And, then tell us the best way to over come it. The book explains us the four wheels of life, where we have to control the steering wheel. The best part i found was the two worksheets given at the end of the book i.e. One us forgiveness worksheet, which helps you to forgive the people and second is Ikigai, this is basically a Japanese word which means 'reason to live' and is best explained in the book. With every chapter comes a tagline which give you insights about the content following and a beautiful quote. . I want to include two lines i really loved from the book as follows:\n\n1)People don't care what you know, unless they know what you care.\n\n2) we don't see things as they are we see things as we are.\n\nNot just these two lines but on every page of this treasure writer put forth the amazing lessons, stories and secrets which is tremendous.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

One of the sayings I read which were that 'A monk went to a king's palace and asked him if he could stay in his hotel. The king in anger shouted it's not a hotel; it's my palace. The monk in a calm voice asks that before you whose place was this? the king told that it was his father palace. The monk asked, and before him? The king with surprised doesn't know why he is asking all this answered that before him, it was his grandfather palace. The monk replied with a simple sigh that, see everyone came and stayed here but left one day and where people come and stay and then leave we called it a Hotel.' This was a simple story but gives the best seek in this world that nothing in this world is yours. Yesterday it was of someone, Today it is yours, but tomorrow it will be someone else. So never depend on the materialistic thing in life.\nBest book. It is telling how to calm in a difficult situation and how to stand in difficult climatic conditions of life.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

This book became a part of my morning routine .\n\nI don't pick up self-help or similar books unless and until someone strongly recommends that to me but i pre-ordered this book . It's bcoz i've been following him for many years and i am also an avid listener of his podcast ' ON PURPOSE' and that made me trust him with his debut book.\n\nAnd if you also like podcasts then i strongly recommend the audiobook version of this book. Trust me! It's quite impactful when he reads out the book to you.\n\nThis s not a book which will tell you how to become successful or how to make more money. You could do all those by yourself if you have a right mind for that and that is what is the highlight of this book i.e 'Peace, Purpose and Mindfulness' and it is rightly the 1st step for everything and in today's world this is 100% relevant.\n\n'Try this' exercises in between the chapters were the best part. He also mentions breath work , visualisation techniques, and chants that are helpful for meditation.\n\nWriting is lucid and i recommend this book to everyone.!!!! Do give it a try...i am sure u'll luv it...\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

Do I want to read about it, learn about it, spend my time doing it""\nAm I here just for the outcome or I want to learn through the process of what it has in store to offer me?\n\nAs I further questioned myself with all these questions, I realized every word mentioned in the book was helping me become more self-aware of myself. It wasn't something that I was hearing for the first time but it was definitely something that my mind, body and soul was trying to tell me all this time but there was too much dust within my clogged thoughts and that's exactly what it helped me with- cleanse. This book has so magnificently captured and articulated emotions of a human mind, people's fear and how they overcome it and described it with examples that any person could relate to in his personal life. Every small details has been explained with verses from Bhagavad Gita and quotes said by famous personalities with examples. This book has not only asks you to read but it gives you activities to perform which help you in becoming more aware of your positives and negatives. Jay's words are so realistic and accomplishable that you'll feel driven to greet each day with discipline and motivation along with guidance that helps everyone achieve their destined journey. This book will successfully manage to break free from the perspective of the outside world and helps in conditioning the strong character in our own lives. I really want people to read this book as it helped me a lot in changing my mindset about my workplace and guided me to achieve my true dharma. Moreover, I truly believe this is just the beginning of the best services and dharma that the author is giving out to the world. And, I am definitely here for the learning process. The outcome will automatically come to us when we start growing exponentially as better individuals in our lives.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

Hope I start implementing the main principle of the book right from here -how monk think at this moment ??(to write a review for the book now ). Myself being a doctor , leading a relatively more stressful phase at this Covid pandemic time , mainly due to fear of acquiring Covid disease to myself , my family members, friends , and others in the society , I am very glad to have read this book. Apart from the normal times, these Covid times have put more of stress , burden , agony and fear to all health care workers in various aspects of their life and draining them physically and mentally. There are also cases reported in healthy people who with the fear of getting covid positive or who are tested positive succumbed to death just due to their mental agony and fear of Covid . So apart from the treatment by medications and vaccines , it requires lot of mental Courage &amp; emotional support to fight and overcome such diseases . So this book in particular is must a read for everyone , to gain mental stability and positivity especially in these pandemic situations. Apart from the social distance precautions, mask wear, Diet , personal hygiene and immune booster supplementation , this book can work as a mental booster to everyone of us .\n\nThe author has beautifully divided the book into three parts - Let Go, Grow and Give , with each of the part having various chapters described under. Right from the first page , the author takes through to a wonderful ride to an enlightened atmosphere driven by a positive energy vehicle . There are various highlighted phrases , quotes and sayings described throughout the book and can be read many a times to develop positive Vibes.There is lot of focus on personality Development , positive emotions and habits described in the book which are motivating . There are beautiful Small Stories described in the book which are given as examples to apply to ourselves .There are real life incidents of the authors lifestyle at the ashram with the monks which makes us get connected and also adding liveliness to the book . The core of the book mainly deals with the different kinds of meditations to train our mind for peace and finding purpose everyday. There’s lot to be experienced internally rather than externally. Hence I am unable to put my book experience in the words .\nApart from name, fame , money , luxuries and etc , there’s lot to be dealt internally which gives more happiness to us such as by our kindness , gratitude and service which are beautifully explained in the book . The main thing which I learnt the most in the book is to find happiness internally and being grateful for what we have in our life .\n\nI would recommend this book to my friends , family members and also people who are mentally sick , so they would go through this wonderful journey of positive energy . Also in this pandemic situation, where home isolation is the main treatment for many of us , this book is a must read to improve our mental , physical and emotional stability .\nWords wouldn’t suffice to express my gratitude or thanks to the author Jayshetty and his team for delivering such a masterpiece book to the world and enhancing many lives . Words are actually short for me to describe the experience I had while reading the book . May you write many more books like these and transform as many as Possible to the positive energy.

I learnt so many lessons of life from this book. The best lesson that i learnt was about mind - Jay Shetty has explained so nicely about two minds, one is your monkey mind &amp; another is your monk mind. And one more lesson was about the four varnas basically we have 4 varnas that is the maker, the creator, the guide &amp; the leader. This varna system opened my mind and we all should think about this so, by this way this present caste system or varna system will be abolished.

And Sir Frankl was a “Holocaust survivor"".\n\nThis book has two parts:\n1.Experiences in a Concentration Camp.\n2.Logotherapy in a Nutshell\n\nThe second part is so impactful and unique that you will re-read this book. The first part mainly is the autobiographical account of Sir, Frankl and the best part is both parts mutually support their credibility.\nThe way he has poured all the pain in this book is not so easy and that too after experiencing it, I was literally shocked because firstly, I was unaware of the term “Holocaust”, maybe I have read before somewhere in History but I was unaware while reading and Secondly, I had never come across something like this.\n\nHe has talked about everything related to life in this book and you know what the best part is even after so much pain, I felt sad but I wasn’t demotivated, I could relate it and with each page-turning, what I found was ‘I am into the book’, suffering all this but I wasn’t tackling all the worst situation in my life as he did.\nSuddenly I started understanding that what life is? what suffering is? and what surviving is? and where am I lacking?\n\nSo, in another way, I discovered the answer to three most important questions which I wanted to be answered since maturity.\n\nI came across a new word “Logotherapy” and I loved that section so much that I will re-read this book.\nIn one line, I learned a lot from this book, which I can further practice to live a peaceful and beautiful life ahead. And this what makes this book worth reading.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

He also keep giving advice after or during the recital of these experiences.\nThe second part is quite complicated. In fact students of psychology and psychiatric will find it easy to understand. It’s important to read it and may be it will take you some time to understand. But some of the concepts are very important to be understood by the millennials in 21st century.\nI would recommend that you read it twice without anyone disturbing you and relate it to your real life incidents. We might not have been in concentration camps but we all have been in situations when we have become hopeless and almost ready to give up.\n\nFont size of the paperback edition for India is really small.

If you are first time reader then I would definitely recommend this book. It is was originally written in Portuguese and later translated in English.\n\nThe story is about a boy from Andalsuia and his adventures through African desert to find treasure in Pyramids of Egypt. One can easily relate with the story because we all have our own goals and this book will teach you that no matter how many obstacles come in your way you should never give up\n\nAs per the quality of book goes, It's not that great, Pages are low quality. But the texts are readable without getting strain in your eyes. So I can say the quality of book is okay\n\nI'm giving 4 star because of the low quality of the book.\nI hope this review will help you in your buying decision.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

This book is about you, me and anyone and everyone .It is about our life, our troubles and tribulations, our goals and the purpose of our existence. To determine our goal ( or Personal Legend as Coelho terms) and to pursue and achieve it is not difficult if we are focused because in the words of Coelho,""..... when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.""\n\nThe story is that of a shepard boy named, Santiago ,from Andulasia. The boy embarks upon a journey in search of a treasure that he had dreamt of. Each one of us are, infact, Santiago, unable to realise when and where we spilt 'the spoon of oil '. As you go through the book you learn that all is not lost and there is hope.\n\nNarrated in a simple lucid manner,the story is interspersed with metaphors ,fables and allegories. Compelling, interesting and full of hope and positivity, The Alchemist is a bedrock of inspiration that instills a strong sense of faith in yourself.\n\nSuch is the power of this book that you will want to read it again and again.

I have read many history books not only modern but also ancient or books on prehistory. But after reading Homosapiens i am just overwhelmed that how the author has presented evolution of human history in such a simplistic , unique and analytical manner.\n This book not only details anthropological evidences or facts but it covers all scenarios to present the picture whether it is biology, genetics, culture, science , environment etc.\nI loved the way the author covered the issue and aspects of religion in human history from early man till today. How and why religion evolved , and how religion is directly related to political and economic power.\nThis book will help you in critical analysis of what we are fed or what we study. This book will force you to form your opinion based on facts and logic rather than some religion or superstitions. Some of the best chapters in the book are:\n1 History biggest fraud\n2 There is no justice in history\n3 The law of religion\n4 The marriage of Science and\n Empires\n5 The End of Homosapiens.\n\nThis book is must read for not only student of history but for all those who are curious enough to understand the concept of how human history evolved.\n\nBOOK SPECIFICATIONS :\n1 Book : Sapiens\n2 Author : Yuval Noah Harari\n3 Language : English\n4 Year : 2015\n5 Publisher : Penguin\n6 Parts/Chapters : 5/20\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

It is an eye opener and as informative as it can get. Harari has literally compiled all the information about our planet and our species and put it in this book. It tells us of the reason why the world that we live in today is the way it is. This book is very informative and important and cannot be described as a casual read.\nI am a quick reader. I can finish a book in a few hours or a day or two, but this book has literally taken me weeks to finish. And I don’t think it is a bad thing at all. It just contains so much information and has so much to tell that I needed time to process all that I was reading about. I would literally stop after a certain topic so I could think about it and process it all and then pick up the book again. No book, and I mean no book at all, can come up to this level of importance on the ‘must-read’ scale.\nIt is very important for us to read this book and understand the way that we as humans have evolved in every way since existing on this planet and the consequences of our decisions on other humans, beings and most importantly, this planet.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don’t even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet’s clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one’s beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‘her’?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that’s just about it. This book isn’t ‘a brief history of humankind’, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn’t a chronological history in the lines of ‘What on Earth Happened?’ by Christopher Lloyd or ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn’t learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends. I have read much better books. 2.5 stars!\n",1,content,1,,,,,,

It was so intriguing for me to read this book (with special mention to my inconsistent non-fiction love) and I've been waiting to get my hands on it.\n\nEverything about this book sounds fascinating... the blurb, the reviews etc. I absolutely loved the first half of the book which talks more about the biological evolution and nomadic and natural lifestyle. It was so very informative and interesting as well.\n\nBut the second half didn't stick with me so much because it was full of historic facts, conquests and stuffs. I felt a bit bored at the later point of time though I would say the same may not happen with all the readers.\n\nThe book is definitely one of the amazing works and a must read for anyone interested in history and the way we humans have become the supremacy on Earth. It in fact made me feel all these advancements we make leads us no where but destruction.\n\nIf you ask me which book apart from fiction would I cherish forever, it would be this book. Because, I knew I would read this book so many times in future because it has so much in it.\n\nWrapping up things, read this book of you are genuinely interested and have done enough research beforehand.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

We share planet Earth with so many diverse animal &amp; plant species, but no other species has changed this planet to the extent we humans have. I always wondered why humans? Why us?\nI got my answers in ‘Sapiens’. A brilliantly written masterpiece by Dr Yuval Noah Harari on history of humankind. Dr Harari has very elaborately explained why Homo Sapiens are different. What has propelled this one species from being just another life form to becoming the most dominant biological entity on Earth? Dr Harari says what distinguishes Homo Sapiens from others is our ability to believe in imagined entities. This enables us to cooperate in large groups.\n“Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination”\nHomo Deus on the other hand talks about future of Homo Sapiens. The future that author has talked about can be a wonder ride, scary, shocking for you depending on how you look at it. If you have already read Sapiens you will feel the Homo Deus being repetitive. Author has devoted significant portion talking about why Homo Sapiens have been successful till now. Most of the key challenges Homo Sapiens faced till 20th century have already been resolved. But will we remain satisfied just because we resolved challenges we have been facing till now? Author says ‘No’\n“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon” -Homo Deus\nIf you want to know what we will be up to I strongly recommend Homo Deus to you. I am sure you will be shocked to read all the possibilities that future holds for our kind.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

I have read many history books not only modern but also ancient or books on prehistory. But after reading Homosapiens i am just overwhelmed that how the author has presented evolution of human history in such a simplistic , unique and analytical manner.\n This book not only details anthropological evidences or facts but it covers all scenarios to present the picture whether it is biology, genetics, culture, science , environment etc.\nI loved the way the author covered the issue and aspects of religion in human history from early man till today. How and why religion evolved , and how religion is directly related to political and economic power.\nThis book will help you in critical analysis of what we are fed or what we study. This book will force you to form your opinion based on facts and logic rather than some religion or superstitions. Some of the best chapters in the book are:\n1 History biggest fraud\n2 There is no justice in history\n3 The law of religion\n4 The marriage of Science and\n Empires\n5 The End of Homosapiens.\n\nThis book is must read for not only student of history but for all those who are curious enough to understand the concept of how human history evolved.\n\nBOOK SPECIFICATIONS :\n1 Book : Sapiens\n2 Author : Yuval Noah Harari\n3 Language : English\n4 Year : 2015\n5 Publisher : Penguin\n6 Parts/Chapters : 5/20\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

It is an eye opener and as informative as it can get. Harari has literally compiled all the information about our planet and our species and put it in this book. It tells us of the reason why the world that we live in today is the way it is. This book is very informative and important and cannot be described as a casual read.\nI am a quick reader. I can finish a book in a few hours or a day or two, but this book has literally taken me weeks to finish. And I don’t think it is a bad thing at all. It just contains so much information and has so much to tell that I needed time to process all that I was reading about. I would literally stop after a certain topic so I could think about it and process it all and then pick up the book again. No book, and I mean no book at all, can come up to this level of importance on the ‘must-read’ scale.\nIt is very important for us to read this book and understand the way that we as humans have evolved in every way since existing on this planet and the consequences of our decisions on other humans, beings and most importantly, this planet.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don’t even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet’s clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one’s beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‘her’?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that’s just about it. This book isn’t ‘a brief history of humankind’, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn’t a chronological history in the lines of ‘What on Earth Happened?’ by Christopher Lloyd or ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn’t learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends. I have read much better books. 2.5 stars!\n",1,content,1,,,,,,

It was so intriguing for me to read this book (with special mention to my inconsistent non-fiction love) and I've been waiting to get my hands on it.\n\nEverything about this book sounds fascinating... the blurb, the reviews etc. I absolutely loved the first half of the book which talks more about the biological evolution and nomadic and natural lifestyle. It was so very informative and interesting as well.\n\nBut the second half didn't stick with me so much because it was full of historic facts, conquests and stuffs. I felt a bit bored at the later point of time though I would say the same may not happen with all the readers.\n\nThe book is definitely one of the amazing works and a must read for anyone interested in history and the way we humans have become the supremacy on Earth. It in fact made me feel all these advancements we make leads us no where but destruction.\n\nIf you ask me which book apart from fiction would I cherish forever, it would be this book. Because, I knew I would read this book so many times in future because it has so much in it.\n\nWrapping up things, read this book of you are genuinely interested and have done enough research beforehand.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

We share planet Earth with so many diverse animal &amp; plant species, but no other species has changed this planet to the extent we humans have. I always wondered why humans? Why us?\nI got my answers in ‘Sapiens’. A brilliantly written masterpiece by Dr Yuval Noah Harari on history of humankind. Dr Harari has very elaborately explained why Homo Sapiens are different. What has propelled this one species from being just another life form to becoming the most dominant biological entity on Earth? Dr Harari says what distinguishes Homo Sapiens from others is our ability to believe in imagined entities. This enables us to cooperate in large groups.\n“Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination”\nHomo Deus on the other hand talks about future of Homo Sapiens. The future that author has talked about can be a wonder ride, scary, shocking for you depending on how you look at it. If you have already read Sapiens you will feel the Homo Deus being repetitive. Author has devoted significant portion talking about why Homo Sapiens have been successful till now. Most of the key challenges Homo Sapiens faced till 20th century have already been resolved. But will we remain satisfied just because we resolved challenges we have been facing till now? Author says ‘No’\n“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon” -Homo Deus\nIf you want to know what we will be up to I strongly recommend Homo Deus to you. I am sure you will be shocked to read all the possibilities that future holds for our kind.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

It was originally recommended to me by my friend.\n\nSince I was on a book buying spree, and I was excited about delving into some new material at the time, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind was one among many books I ended up ordering.\n\n I’ve finally gotten around to reading it. Of course, it helps that I’ve been in the habit of reading one book per week for several months now.\n\nSummary: The Power of Your Subconscious Mind was written by a leading expert on the subject, Joseph Murphy. From my perspective, this book equates your subconscious mind with God, which is likely a different and challenging paradigm for same to accept.\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

The book entails multiple techniques (visualisation, meditation) and healing practices (placebo effect) to utilise the power of our subconscious to derive happiness from within, to rejuvenate health, to attract wealth, to heal relationships, and ultimately to receive what we seek..\n\n Below are few highlights from the book:\n\n🎯Think good and good follows. Think evil and evil follows. You are what you think all day long.\n🎯As you sow in your subconscious mind, so shall you reap in your body and environment.\n🎯Imagine your subconscious mind as a bed of rich soil that will help all kinds of seeds to sprout and flourish, whether good or bad.\n🎯Every thought is a cause, and every condition is an effect. This is the reason it is so essential that you take charge of your thoughts. In that way, you can bring forth only desirable conditions.\n🎯You have the power to choose. Choose life! Chose love!

It has an impact to change your perspectives towards life for the better. Also, the author has given a fine light on both the conscious and subconscious mind. As a non-fictional book, this book says a lot about many things from staying positive to controlling your mind and emotions.\n\nThough the flow is not always good in this book and even some chapters sounded too heavy that was next to impossible to tolerate. On the brighter side, some chapters were really good and on the point. That is the only reason that giving 3.5 stars out of 5 would not be a bad option at all.\n\nLastly, you can't take this one as a regular self-help book. This is a bit different and some concepts are explained superbly by the author. Anyone who likes to read a book about controlling the mind and winning life then he/she must grab this as the title goes.\n\nFav Quote: ""Busy your mind with the concepts of harmony, health, peace, and good will, and wonders will happen in your life.""\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n",0,content,0,,,,,,

Different kinds of suits are meant for different occasions. And, this one is good for work. Don't expect wardrobe for every kind of occasion just from a single blazer.

Excellent quality under 900rs,"\n Off late I ordered this pair of cycling shorts since I was a bit weary of the BTWIN shorts which I was using. These costed under 900rs which is a great price point for something this good in quality.\n\nWhat is Good:\n\n- The fit was excellent. Its a bit longer than traditional shorts. So it does grip the quads &amp; hams very well. Helps in longer rides - the added support &amp; compression.\n- The padding is very good. May not be Brevet grade but should be perfect for city rides. I have done 45-50km rides in this &amp; they held up pretty well. No fatigue whatsoever.\n- The Material is spandex based and breathes very well. Moisture wicking to say the least. The mesh material feels natural &amp; light on your skin.\n- The circumference around the thighs have this anti slip rubber lining which helps a lot to keep these in place. What is even better is that the rubber lining becomes more sticky as you sweat.\n- Feels natural to wear under a trouser or a pair of jeans. Please note, these will add a bit of bulk to your waist so if you wear a tight pair of jeans or trousers, it may become tight for comfort. But with an average pair of jeans, these are perfect to wear all day. There is a bit of bulge around the back which is to be expected given the padding. Yes- it is possible to wear it all day under jeans.\n- Quick dry material. So once I reach office, I take these off and drop em off on the bike to dry out. And I have noticed that these are dry within a hour or two.\n\nWhat could have been improved:\n\n- Sizing is very confusing. And I realized this after having to return &amp; reorder the product once. The sizing imagine should make it clear as to why. Asian Size is L but American Size is S while European size is M. For Indian, Asian size is the best reference. American size as always plus sizes.\n- This leads to the next point. I ordered Size M (Asian) which I exchanged for Size S (Asian). I usually wear size 32 jeans in Levis. Which means, anyone who has a slimmer waistline than 32 inches won't be able to get a size smaller than Size S. Since they dont have XS.\n\nNonetheless, these are great for everyday usage.\n\nOverall, this is a good product for the price. I use it for commuting to work everyday. So far, I have had not reason to complain - especially given the attractive price. And the padding is pretty great!\n",0,fit,0,style,0,fabric,0,,

Consider hip-size for waist-size and you should get perfect fit.,"\n As evident from all other reviews, I was trying to get the right fit the first time. I found most of the users have ended up purchasing a size higher when they ordered based on waist-size chart provided in the product picture.\n\nMy waist is 34 inches. If I considered XL (going by size chart), I would have ended up with a very loose shorts (as complained by others). Instead I checked for 34 inches in Hip size and the closest one is ""S"" i.e. Small. So I went with that.\nItem was delivered yesterday and I found it fit perfectly.\n\n1 star dropped for the high price. This is china made and the ideal price should have been around Rs.500/-. I paid Rs.998. Nevertheless it's a good buy and I would recommend this for anybody planning to go on long trips on bike.\n-------------\nAlso, if the vendor is reading reviews, by now he should have uploaded the correct size chart to avoid the unnecessary time spent on research and trial and errors.\n",0,fit,0,,,,,,

I have been using this shorts for nearly 4 days and covered nearly 200kms in a day for ride. Feeling was amazing. Not only that I didnt get any tail bone pain, but also I was very comfortable throughout the ride. In bicycle I'm yet to have a long ride. But from the average rides I had so far I'm very comfortable there also. Make sure u get the right size for the best experience. My waist size is 32, I got large size which is very comfortable.

So I test rode with a supporter inside the shorts. Did 15 kms uphill without any discomfort. Before the shorts, groin pain would start to surface after 7-8 kms (unless you wear that tight supporter!). On following days, I even got rid of the supporter; no discomfort.\n\nGoes without saying, these come highly recommended from me, especially to those struggling with groin discomfort while riding.\n\nI hope these are durable too. Will come back with an update after some rigorous use!\n\nAlso, a note of thank you to fellow riders and the seller for promptly answering answering my queries, and helping to zero in on this buy.\n",0,fabric,0,texture,0,,,,

Also tried to pair and unpair several times to establish a firm connection. I was able to download and install 2 firmware updates in a mere span of 48 hours pushing the firmware to release 11. Post this bluetooth connectivity has improved. I also had to update the Noise app twice in these 5 days which has improved the connectivity and sync.\n\nThe watch was packed with zero battery and firmware 6. Wish Noise had made a better effort at solving issues before shipping the product to customers. Moving my rating from one to 4 stars as the watch has now started performing better and am happier with it now.\n\nSleep record is good, SPO2 and tracking is good as well.\n\nDAY ONE REPORT: Bluetooth connectivity is iffy to say the least. Doesn’t pair with the device even while the phone is side by side. Wrist sense is annoying. Comes on only after a second of wrist movement for any other watch face than the default one.\n\nThe battery drained in 48 hours. I guess because the device was constantly trying to pair with my phone and couldn’t.\n\nThe noise fit app is riddled with bugs. Especially on startup. The app just doesn’t move and sticks to a blank screen. A fix for this is that the location needs to be on before switching the app on.\n\nSleep mode does not work or register any data.\n\nAnguish at trying to connect to the company’s support after just 48 hours of purchase.\n\nCannot return or replace, that’s another hassle all together.\n\nStuck with this and has left a bitter sense since this is my first wearable. Please skip this brand and model. Better to save 1.5 grand a month for 10 months and buy a Samsung or Apple Watch.\n",0,software,0,battery,0,,,,

Nothing was off the card, whatever was mentioned on the product discription the same delivered, be it in terms of its look and even the features. The accuracy of the Oximeter and the pulse check, is I would say 90%. You see, none of the products can accurately guve a reading. The display is legible and easy to read. Its comfortable to wear and has no sharp edges. It's been just a day, and I am Impressed. How it holds up in a longer run will be something to watch out for..

No glitches till now and still have 45 percent battery remaining. So I guess at least ten days of back up on full charge which is pretty decent in this price range.\nThe Dafit app is also very nice.

There are 9 sports modes - walk, run, treadmill, bike, hike, climbing, workout, spinning, yoga. There are No Call functions, No Camera control,\nBattery:- Lasts for about 10-11 days which is a good thing. You won't complain about battery anyway.\nQuality:- soft silicon belt is nice and no problem with the skin.\nDisplay:- little scratches starts to appear without protection, although with me using it rough, it is nice though.\nDisadvantage:- I bought 2 of them(1 for my friend) and the firmware version in the watch is different for both even after update. I had multiple customisable dials options available in one watch, while only 5 fixed dials in the other one which is really disappointing.\nFinal verdict:- if you're first time smartwatch buyer, it is better than your analog and digital watch but not a real smartwatch as it misses out many functions. Would suggest you to increase your budget and get a real smartwatch from fossil, oppo or apple.\nAlso if you're still looking forward to buy this wait for sale, the price drops significantly.\n",0,battery,0,style,0,,,,

If we talk. About the watch it has some good features that one should need in daily routine like notification of WhatsApp messages calls but the Bluetooth range is not that good also battery backup is not upto the expectations... I bought this for my younger brother as he just got his new phone and during his online classes when he was on break can put the phone on charge and watch gives notification after break gets over so quiet useful for him...

MiBand crusher.","\n &nbsp;Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.\n\n----------------------\n?? IN THE BOX\n----------------------\n? The smart watch module with screen protector applied\n? 22mm wide TPU strap\n? Charging cable\n? Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card\n\n--------------------\n? FEATURES\n--------------------\n? 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display\n? Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,\n? IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof\n? 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby\n? Bluetooth 5.0 BLE\n? 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.\n? App, message, social media and call notifications.\n? Music control\n? Menstrual cycle tracking\n? 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.\n\n---------------------\n??? MY USAGE\n---------------------\n? At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.\n? The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.\n? The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.\n? The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.\n? There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.\n? The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.\n? There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.\n? The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).\n? Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.\n? The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.\n? I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.\n? There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.\n\n-------------------------\n?? WHAT I LIKED\n-------------------------\n? The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.\n? Battery life of 7 to 10 days.\n? IPX68 dust and waterproof.\n? Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring\n? Better control &amp; display of calls, messages and music from the band\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n?? WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED\n-------------------------------------------------\n? More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.\n? Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.\n\n-------------------\n?? OVERALL\n-------------------\nThe MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. ??\n",0,price,0,style,0,battery,0,,

This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SNS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).\nHeart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof(follow the IP68 standard). Dont use in salt water, it can damage.\nMy usage is very high and still i get 4 days battery back up. Its pretty good.\n\nAccording to the cost of the product, you cant expect more than that. Its recommended to use this product.\n",0,packaging,0,software,0,display,0,battery,0

I really need a smart watch which can track my daily activity, give me a stylish look and provide me various notifications. As usual my first thought was about apple watch.\n\nWhy I preferred noise colorfit pro 2?\nApple watch is very nice, which is a real smart watch. But problem is poor battery life.\n\nDo you really think of charging ur apple watch daily?\nIn today’s life already I hv wireless earpods, loud speaker and smartphone which need to be charged daily. Really I don’t want to add one more thing to the list.\nDo you really need a smart watch to answer calls or reply messages when ur phn is in ur pocket or near by (bcoz if phn is not nearby then these features will not work)? If yes then believe me u r too lazy ??.\n\nPros of colorfit pro 2: stylish look, working flawlessly with my iPhone. I can receive all notifications, read messages, control music (working nicely with gaana app, even if gaana app is not open, by clicking play button songs can be played). The activity tracker is also working fine. Good battery life.\n\nCons: Only 5 watch faces (request to noise to update number of watch faces which ll make this watch awesome)\nUnder bright sunshine, screen is hardly visible (the only thing with respect to which amazfit bip lite is the winner)\n\nVerdict: U can definitely try this watch though it is really not a smartwatch. In India, smartwatch technology is at nascent stage. So don’t expect much as compared to smartphones. Presently Smartwatch technology in India is like smartphone technology that was 5years ago. So better wait sometimes to use this smart technology at affordable price and let the rich people to enjoy the things for now??\n",0,style,0,software,0,battery,0,,

It’s waterproof and dust proof (a must have)\n4. Light weight and ergonomic design\n5. Setup is a breeze\n6. Activity tracking, heart rate (continuous monitoring) and sleep statistics with added health and wellness feature is a boon\n7. Capacitive touch panel is slick\n\nNot so great -\n1. Limited watch faces\n2. Build quality can improve\n3. Lacks camera remote module (basic fitness band version has it though)\n4. Interface can improve to make it more intuitive\n\nOverall a satisfactory product to own and worth recommending.

This version or the latest version of the app is not able to track sleep hours at all, it will show you steps for today but by tomorrow everything will be gone.

I think it has good value for money. For a low price of 2500 INR, I got a solid performer. I have had smartbands before, but they are like teasers for smartwatches. I wanted to have a proper smartwatch and decided to go with an Indian brand, since Indian brands like Noise and Boat have started making great products. I have to say, I am happy with my decision. The product is easy to use and setup. There have been no drops in connectivity since I have started using it. And most importantly, wearing it all day doesn't make me feel uncomfortable in anyway. It gives me a good track of what I need to know when I am working out and what to aim for. Now, I am really wondering, what is the value point for a smart watch? For 2500 INR I get features like heart rate monitoring, around 10 work out modes, calorie counter and notifications sync with my phone, what else is really needed for a smart watch?\n",0,price,0,fit,0,software,0,,

According to her, this toor dal cooks extremely well that too much faster as compared to local ones. Also it's unpolished dal which retains all vital nutrients in it.\n\nFOR :\n\n+ Cooks better &amp; much faster\n+ Easily blendable after cooking\n+ Unpolished\n+ Not at all expensive\n+ Tasty, healthy and clean\n+ Superior quality\n\nAGAINST : Literally nothing\n\nIndian diet is highly protein deficient. Dal is one of protein sources for vegan people although it's not whole protein. So one should not rely completely on dals for protein needs.\n\nTill date I bought more than 8 kgs of it. Never had a single problem. It was packed very well and I received packets in intact condition on time. Because of discounted price tag, I keep buying it again &amp; again.\n\nI have blind faith on Tata products. Tata's have special place in my heart.\n\nI hope this helped you. 🙂\n",0,price,0,quality,0,,,,

As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:\nPros:\nA great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]\nThe best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]\nSomewhere between great to excellent battery life\nThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC\nThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.\n\nCons:\nMany buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.\nYou will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.\nThe display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.\nAnd also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.\n\nConclusion with personal thoughts:\nOverall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.\n",1,Camera,0,Battery,0,Display,1,,

I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.\n",0,,,,,,,,

After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.\n\n-----------------------************------------------------\n\nHere are the pros from the last few days of usage:\n\n1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).\n\n2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.\n\n3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.\n\n4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.\n\n5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.\n\n6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).\n\n7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.\n\n------------------------***********-----------------------\n\nCons:\n\n1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.\n\n2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.\n\n3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.\n\n4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).\n\n5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.\n\n6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.\n\n--------------------************----------------------\n\nFinal words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.\n\n***************************************\nLove the black color.\n***************************************\n\nFun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.\n",0,,,,,,,,

She was very keen to have her own iPhone. On 20 oct 2020, after receiving the package I opened it and switched on the iPhone. It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don’t want a “repaired tag” in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can’t demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don’t know what Apple is going to do.\nIn the meantime Amazon and the seller are happy to have sold a faulty product to me and the poor me after running from pillar to post is waiting for the mercy of Apple.\n",1,Display,1,Service,1,,,,

(also they work best together)\nOverall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.\nAnd When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!\nAll in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Shoot an uninterrupted video of the delivery you receive from the delivery guy and unboxing\n2. Ensure you capture the entire phone and accessories and point out any damage/defect (if observed)\n3. Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei\n4. Boot the phone and wait for ""Apple logo to load"" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy\n5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock\n6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides\n7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaults\n\nWhat did I like about this phone?\n1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced)\n2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features\n3. Super fluid OS experience - Now I understood what ""Buttery experience meant all these years""\n4. Battery life is good, Screen-On-Time of ~7hours depending on the usage - I had my Wifi continuously switched on and Bluetoth for ~2hrs - I must say for 3100mah battery it very well optimized compared to 4000mah of other phones\n5. Wireless charging - (Which might be useful for some people but not me)\n6. A great deal from Security, Experience, Durability and Hardware Perspective\n7. Still providing Charger and Earpods(Wired) - So better go for this compared to Apple online store\n\nWhat is not present but doesn't make difference?\n1. 90Hz display could have made it amazing but can't expect that from a year-old model and doesnt make difference in india at least\n2. 5G is not present - So, good to go for 2-3years without updating any further than IOS15\n3. InBox charger could have been 12W(2hr charging time) charger instead of 5W(3.5hr charging time) - OnePlus provide 40min charging\n4. Super Amoled could have improved the viewing experience but its still fine\n\nRecommendation: If can spend up to 55k then just go for it without any hesitation. Better than any 40-50k phone out there. Colors available are also great. I was looking for Mint but didn't get it. Try your luck though. Hope this helped.\n",0,,,,,,,,

According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.\n One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.\n Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.\n Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.\n Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.\n Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but, my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.\n",0,,,,,,,,

I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.\n\nNow about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.\nThe camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.\n2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.\nThe Battery backup is decent.\nThe Sound Quality is nice.\nFace recognition is really fast.\nScreen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.\nOverall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.\nHope this helps ! ✌🏼\n",0,,,,,,,,

Go through my review carefully before buying.\n\nI had iPhone 5s as my first phone. It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.\n\nI grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster. Will update the review after few months.\n\nBuild quality is remarkable.\n\nIOS 14 is a magic.\n\nPhone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.\n\nDo not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.\n\nI was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision. Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.\n\nFront and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.\nIf you are a photo person, this one is for you.\n\nFinal verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship, be ready for repeated charge cycles. 😅\n\nThis is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.\n\nDo check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.\n\nCheck the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.\nThanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.\n\nUpdate after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. 😍😍\n",0,,,,,,,,

I am disappointed as it was shown the airpods with the phone but instead of that they send the wired earphones. If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least. I am waiting if the airpods are being sent by the seller else will return the phone due to wrong description . How ever other things are fine and looks are great. Will give a brief review later.

Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\n\nCOMFORT :\n------------\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\n\nLOUDNESS :\n-------------\nCX180 &gt; boAt 225 &gt; JBL CS100SI\n\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\n\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids &amp; lows ) :\n---------------------------------------------\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids &amp; lows, which are strong &amp; Crisp. But bass levels are different.\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\n\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\n----------------------------------\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\nNOTE: boAt &amp; JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\n\nCUSTOMER CARE :\n--------------------\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\n\nCONNECTIVITY :\n------------------\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\n\nVERDICT :\n----------\nI don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\n\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.\n",0,,,,,,,,

They wont let you down when the beat drops :P\n- Being an Audiophile whose working for brands like Yamaha, Jamo Dynaudio, mission amd many more these are the best for music to hear ever subtle note however I have to keep in my that I paid 599 for these on a lightning deal which makes the superb value for money while listening to music.\n- Gold plated connector pin for higher conductivity.\n- Clear microphone quality over call or while recording a vlog.\n- lightweight due to which they are not a burden on your ears and don't fall of your ears easily.\n- Cable spread adjustable lock built-in.\n\nCons:\n- Gold plating on connector pin is slightly wearing of after 6 months.\n- There are better bass heavy earphones at this or lower price point. But this is very subjective to the genre of music you listen too. As to much bass kills the Mids &amp; Highs. So you can call these headphones as balanced.\n\nConclusion:\nGo for these if you're looking for a pair of branded earphone under 999/- with a microphone which will last you for a reasonable long time &amp; have good quality balanced sound for movies and music.\n\nIf you found this review useful make sure to hit the HELPFUL button under the review.\n Happy shopping\n Gills Guide.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Just buy!!!,\n Superb product!! This is my 2nd time buying these earphones. Before these I purchased Sennheiser cx 180 street 2 but in just 3 months the sound quality dropped to minimum. Had to switch back to JBL.\n\nSo here's the detailed review...\n\nPros :\n\n1. Sound : Too great. Had to put my sound bar to half. Quality doesn't lessens even at the max sound. Bass is superb too.\n\n2. Built quality : marvelous built. One thing I like about JBL is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old. Built quality has been upgraded. Only thing I wanted was L shaped lead but it's fine.\n\n3. Noise cancellation : great noise cancellation. You can totally rely on this. Once you put on everything will seem great about it.\n\n4. Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.\n\nCons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it. It will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully.\n\nHope this will help you decide.\nHave a nice day!!\n,0,,,,,,,,

And if the music is on, you won't be able to listen majority of things going on outside. Even in great traffic, it cuts the noise to half of the original intensity without any music. With music,it cuts off the noise upto 97%.\n2.Sound is perfectly balanced.It was a great experience to listen to all the genres with it.I had absolutely no problem with it. It's been a year now since I am using them and they are still perfect man!👌👌👌\n3. Mike is located at the perfect spot and has a good power if catching sound. The mike button also works pretty well.\n4. Have recommended it to all my friends and they loved it too.\nCon:-\nThis may be only in my case. Because my ears are the smallest ears to be found(according to my family and friends)😄😄😄 and only the smallest size of ear buds fit in my ears. And I didn't get the smallest size of earbuds with this earphone.So, had to arrange it from outside.\nThat's not a big issue as it seems. But lemme tell you, if the earbuds are not fitting perfectly inside, then, audio experience and the noise cancellation property, all goes in vain because your earphones would be falling out of your ear every now and then which is very irritating.\n2. And being from a middle class household, Honestly it was a bit costly for me🙄...but i saved money and purchased it.No regrets for that. It's awesome.But to prevent any damage to it,I covered it up with cover(spiral wires).\nOtherwise, no problem at all. It's the perfect earphone in this price range👌\nTotally happy😊\n",0,,,,,,,,

DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED,"\n Firstly, I have been using this earphones for about two months, and I haven't seen one single problem. The length is a little too long, but it's okay. Noise cancellation is just mind blowing. Even if you just put them on and not play anything also, you can't hear people talking around you. But if it's at full volume, even if battles are going on around you, you can't hear them(a little exaggeration, haha) If you are an extreme basshead, please go for boAt. The bass in this earphones is basically non existent, but hey, you don't buy JBL for the bass, but for the pure sound(which is wonderful, by the way) Even if you are a person who likes the Apple model of earphones, and not the shove in the ear type(like me), you won't find any problem with the comfort, thanks to the angled design. Finally, definitely buy this product, but wait until the price becomes 549 Indian rupees(about 7.45 US Dollars, 6.09 Euros) , because Amazon sometimes makes it 700 Indian Rupees(9.5 US Dollars, 7.78 Euros). Whatever type of person you are, you will find these earphones an absolute delight. I loved them, and I have given them a 5 star rating on everything except the bass. I recommend the white version(ONLY CAUSE IT LOOKS BETTER). Hope this review helps a lot of people. If it helped anyone, please say so. I will feel happy.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Realme is 1inch longer than JBL c100si. But Realme gives 6 months warranty and JBL gives 1 year warranty. Both has mic. But JBL has one control button and Realme has three buttons, one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume. JBL hasn't any rubber band/strap to organise it's cable. Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.\n\nNow comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ₹600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme. Bass and treble everything is clear and the sound doesn't disturb your ear. I can say it sounds like Sony music system. You will surely love to listen music with JBL c100si earphone.\n\nIn terms of fitting, both are good. But JBL has little bit edge over Realme because of it's shape. And Realme is slightly heavier than JBL.\n\nRegarding call quality, I didn't find any difference in call quality in either of these earphones. The sound is clear in both ends.\n\nHope this review will give you a clear idea to choose the right one...👍\n",0,,,,,,,,

May cause disconnection if bend carelessly.\n\nChord wire\nBoat: very strong high quality thick wire which can last for long\nJBL: very thin , light weight structure which I think will not have long life.\nIt got cut within a week.worst.\n\nMic\nBoat: it's little longer with good material quality.\nJBL: small low quality, light weight material but the function seems to be good.It has got small clip to stop the unwanted movement of mic.\n\nHeadphone\nBoat: The design seems to be special and overall good.\nJBL: Standard design with a better fit.\n\nSound quality\nBoat: Good sound quality.\nJBL: Good sound quality with more bass.\n\nWarranty\nBoat: warranty is there\nJBL: No warranty. Just throw away if damaged.\n\nVerdict: With almost same sound quality, Boat seems to be having the upperhand according to me due to the built material quality. In JBL,The chord wire, mic and the plug neck seems to be vulnerable. And there is a ""made in China"" sticker in JBL too(If you are bothered about the make).\nThe cost of JBLCS100 is more than even Boat225, so you can even go for that.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Whether it be taste or consistency, it faired well and will be given preference on my shelves for long.\n\n•••••••••••••••••••\nGENERAL INFO\n•••••••••••••••••••\n\nPrice MRP: Rs 320\nQty: 290g\nCalories: 533Kcal/100g of spread\nSugar Content: 56.3g/100g of spread\n\n•••••••\nPROS\n•••••••\n1. Balanced sweetness &amp; chocolate flavor.\n2. Rich cocoa flavor to suit any of the tastebuds.\n3. Spreads easily without any trouble.\n4. The hint of Hazelnut is a nice addon.\n5. Wide-open jar for easy access &amp; airtight for longevity. If kept open it dries up soon.\n\n•••••••\nCONS\n•••••••\n1. Only one con is the cost, but again you get what you pay for. Lower the cost and accept the tradeoffs, like thin consistency, sugary taste, odd flavor, etc.\n\nCons is not at all a product issue. This spread is greatest of all. In fact, i will give it 6 stars, as i already gave 5 to Dairymilk spread.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nDairy Milk Spread Vs Hersheys Vs Nutella\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nPersonally, I found Dairy Milk spread to be slightly better than Hershey’s owing to the reasons below. But again it’s slightly costly compared to Hershey’s.\n\n1. Thicker consistency spread\n2. More chocolaty taste (more like a simple version of dairy milk chocolate)\n\nFurther, i found Nutella better than Dairymilk, owing to reasons below. Again here, it's further costly.\n\n1. Rich cocoa or chocolate flavor. Not just Dairymilk taste.\n2. Uniform &amp; balanced consistency. Dairymilk spreads consistency was non-uniform and at times way too thick to spread.\n\n▶ Arranging them from BEST → WORST in different domains:\n\nCost Front (Price per g): Hersheys (0.74) - DairyMilk (1.00) - Nutella (1.10)\nTaste Front: Nutella - DairyMilk - Hersheys\nBalanced consistency: Nutella - DairyMilk - Hersheys\n\n••••••••••••••••••\nFinal VERDICT\n••••••••••••••••••\n\nNutella is any time recommended over other spreads if you could go with the cost. Its balanced spread with rich taste which won't ever disappoint any of cocoa flavor lover.\n\n▶ Many people comment on the sugar content of spreads, but these are meant to be that way else you would end up applying more of it to have the taste. Also reducing it will have a significant impact on cost.\n\n▶ You may try all of Hershey’s, Nutella and Dairy milk and then finalize your taste. Each is unique in its own way.\n",0,quality,0,taste,0,,,,

The box I got was new, and the MFG is just the previous month.\nBefore I come to the actually taste, I would like to inform you that only 100% natural have that oil separation from the nuts, if exposed to warm climates. Therefore, if you see that it's too liquidy, it's GOOD. It signifies that no emulsifiers had been used, which other companies such as Sundrop and Disano use. However, to get the solid texture back, mix the peanut butter for a while (it was quite a job to do in the 2.5 KG box), and put it in the fridge. It'll have a solid texture by the next morning. I use it to make mass gainers and oats, and rarely as a spread.\nWell. Now, coming to the taste, to be honest, if you have tried sweetened peanut butter, or something like Nutella, this will taste worse. Because it's healthier!\n\nBut, worse does NOT mean 'bad'. You'll get used to the taste quite soon, it's like an unflavored protein powder, or like pure paneer, if you get my point. No special taste, neither good nor bad. I've done the math, 2.5kg saves a lot of money, so I bought that one. It's up to you, but that box will definitely last you a few months. I'll try the Organic Peanut Butter after this, since I love this one. Get this over any other brand.\nYou'll not regret it.\n",0,quality,0,,,,,,

I think they have adulterated this peanut butter with water and surprisingly the price is also bit on the higher side. The packaging is good, no spilling, taste was also good and received a fresh stock. Since I am paying for the peanut and not the water, this makes my first and last purchase from pintola.

After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.\n\nSPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience specially when you have a lots of color copies to do.\n\nPRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm. ONE MORE major problem is print head need to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.\n\nPAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the EPSON web page , B&amp;W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.\n\nMy verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Print speed is very fast and much better than canon and hp but the print quality is not that good if you compare with canon printers\n3.Now the best thing about the printer is hp and\nCanon use print head where the ink dries but this printer stores the ink where it has to print and then prints it that's the main reason why I bought it above hp and canon\n\nCons:-\n1.Very big compared to hp and canon printers\n2.Is a bit expensive than hp and canon\n3.Paper gets stuck if you a slight old paper and if you use a paper that is folded the ink gets printed in the paper you( can notice it in the first photo)\n\nAnd I see many people ask can you print with you mobile with the usb version\n\nAns:Yes you can print with noko print application though you can see some adds in the app\n\nI have written by using 30 minutes of my time hope you find it helpful\n\nAnd if you are confused where to buy from amazon or Flipkart I would recommend you to purchase it from amazon\n,0,,,,,,,,

No clear steps given on how to set up the connection to home wifi router need to break the head a little bit\n6. Ink filling is so easy and spill proof design\n7. Low cost printing per page, 7p for black, 18p for color\n8. Ink bottle T003 is also reasonably cheap around 400/450 per bottle\n9. Value for money. One time investment in right direction for longer run\n10. Scanner and photocopier is so great work like charm\n11. Already scanned a copy book for my kid. Print quality is in great color even on normal paper, yet to try on photo paper\n12. A must have for home use or small office purpose\n13. Light weight and compact design\n14. Don't think more go for it\n",0,,,,,,,,

I needed one for home printing which was cheap to operate and use. It was received in very good packing. After seeing a couple of YouTube videos and the attached instructions I was able to install it myself. It was a breeze doing it. Using the CD was able to install and configure the printer over the WiFi connection. I also installed the Epson imprint app on my Samsung M31 and it detected the printer immediately. Now, I am able to print from both devices easily. I took a photocopy first which came out fine. I then printed some photographs (attached) which are pretty decent (though not as bright as originals but not totally unexpected). I didn't try the scan but should work fine seeing the way photocopy worked.\nLooking forward to using it.\n",0,,,,,,,,

However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,\nThe quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.\nＶｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇ\nUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.\n\nThe Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.\nPerformance -\nOver all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.\n\nOverall summary -\nIn this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!\n",0,,,,,,,,

The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.\n2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.\n3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.\n4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.\n\nCons:\n1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.\n2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Phone. Is. Everything. 💯,"\n Best buy for anyone! Price point seems brilliant for all the specs that come with the phone. I have my phone on me 24/7... so I think I can speak for most of the people out there who are looking for a mid priced SMARTphone. Everything has been smooth. Decent display. No lag whatsoever, although, I did have doubts seeing the processor this came with. I still love this phone. Fingerprint reader scans quick and is hassle free. The battery life is amazing. Fully charged, it lasts me a day with heavy use (almost 24hrs). I particularly love how sharply detailed the zoom is on this phone and the macro mode is LOVE. Many more modes which I didn't particularly use but looked good on just my first try like the slow mo and a mode just for food pics! You've got a lot of features that you'd get on expensive phones like the A series and I've only mentioned what I love the most here. Go for the M31 for the Quad cam and the monster battery life. The space black color option looks pretty cool and sleek. Not disappointed.. yet? No regrets🤩\n",0,,,,,,,,

Go for it without any doubt.,"\n This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.\n\nGood:\n\n- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!\n- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.\n- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.\n- 6000 Mah battery is BIG\n- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.\n- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE\n- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.\n- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.\n- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.\n- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good\n- Received next day by 11 AM !\n\nNot So Good:\n\n- Not that thin, but ok.\n- Doesn't have Samsung Dex\n- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.\n- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)\n- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.\n\nFeedback\n\n- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.\n- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.\n\nGo for it without any doubt.\n",0,,,,,,,,

First of all let me tell you that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play &amp; Lenovo K8 Note.\n2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.\n3. PROS.\n(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek &amp; stylish to look at.\n(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.\n(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.\n(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.\n(e) With quad camera &amp; a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.\n(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.\n(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.\n4. CONS.\n(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.\n(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.\n5. I'm satisfied with the phone &amp; the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs &amp; brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",0,,,,,,,,

It is a good Video viewing experience.\n2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.\n3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.\n4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.\n5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.\n6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.\nI think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.\n\nThanks.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.\n2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.\n3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.\n\nCons:\n1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.\n2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.\n3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.\n4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.\n\nVerdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.\n------------------------------------------------------\nGreat Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.\nAlso another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.\nAfter 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging. Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.\nPhone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.\nEdit: After 9 months of usage: I am not facing the heating issues now. I had the heating problem while using hotspot for entire day. Battery backup is also good now. But facing some issues in camera. After the latest software update, the photos are some times showing our face like a black and white. This issue is happening only few times and the issue is on only around face. Complained to samsung but no action taken. They are asking for more logs from my phone. Other than this, phone is good to use.\n",0,,,,,,,,

As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Excellent camera and battery for this price.,"\n I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.\nMy first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.\nThe rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.\nPlayed pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.\nSo here are the pros and cons\nPROS:\n- Price\n- Camera\n- Battery\n- Display\n- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.\n\nCONS:\n- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.\n- Charging could be faster\n\nFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.\n",0,,,,,,,,

I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.\n",0,,,,,,,,

After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.\n\n*Camera:\n\nRear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.\nFront camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.\n\n* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.\n\n* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:\n--&gt; Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)\n--&gt; 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming\n--&gt; 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)\nDisclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.\n\n* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.\n\n* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.\n\n* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.\n\n* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).\n\n* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...\n--&gt; Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)\n--&gt; Personally love the Dark Mode.\n\nOverall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\n",0,,,,,,,,

So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.,"\n I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.\nThis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.\n\nNow coming to the phone :\n\nPros :-\n1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.\n2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.\n3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.\n4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.\n5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.\n6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.\nOther conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nNow coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\n1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.\n2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.\n3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.\n\nOverall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\n",0,,,,,,,,

Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.\n1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover, please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile, I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).\n2. CAMERA, I use to take lot of mobile photographs it's my hobby, I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough, since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures, camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....\n3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak, when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...\n4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi, but it is not like earlier Samsung.\n5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening, but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.\nSamsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked\n",0,,,,,,,,

I don't play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being an experienced smartphone user i can tell ... it can run any game without lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm ri8) .

The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.\n2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.\n3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.\n4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.\n5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.\n6. Battery life is quite very good.\n7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.\n8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.\n9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.\nCons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.\n2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.\n3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.\n4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.\n5. The charging is a bit slow.\n6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.\n7. The sound output could have been more.\n8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.\n9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.\nThe phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.\n",0,,,,,,,,

I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.\nAfter this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.\nI like the look &amp; feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.\nOverall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front &amp; rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.\nFor me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).\nIn short, I would say, it is a value for money device.\nI purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.\nI have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Waste of money and time! 😑,"\n Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...\n\nI wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.\n\nWhen we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!\n\nWe had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑\n\nIt’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!\n",1,,,,,,,,

This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.\n\nThe new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode &amp; then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.\n",1,,,,,,,,

At highest resolution you cannot use the zoom to take the pictures. Sound quality is clear but could be louder. Not a heavy device. Wifi connectivity is fine. Display is superb. Speed is fine but sometimes lagging make you feel that for 8GB RAM it could be better. I connected my 1TB hard drive to it and it had no problems to read it.

Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.\nI am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android &amp; miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.\nHas a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.\nExynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.\n\nExtra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.\nLarger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.\n\nOver all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.\n\nAnother area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review\n\nThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThat said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.\n\nIn low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.\n\nComing to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.\n\nOn the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.\nAt this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example - AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!\nThis phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.\nI also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.\nConclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone\n",0,,,,,,,,

Exynos processor dissapoints,"\n It's a great phone to buy on Big sales or Deep discount sales days. The phone is definitely worth buying for 14k or less but not beyond that. The Exynos processor is what made me think twice. Would have beeen great if they had SD processor. Nontheless Exynos does a decent job but definitely nowhere near Qualcomm SD.\n\nPros\n* Amoled - Display is pretty good\n* Camera - Camera is extremely good for a phone priced at 14k\n* Sound - Not that clear/sharp while attending calls but Ok, not bad either\n* Battery - super good.. lasts 1 day on heavy use and 1.5days for normal use\n\ncons\n* Processor - Exynos instead of SD\n* Battery charging - says fast charging but takes at least 2.5 hours for full charge\n* Packaging - No laminated one time use screen protector (the laminated kind of sheet) is provided. Tempered glass has to be put immediately after receiving to prevent unnecessary scratches or damages.\n* Silicon Cover - it would hardly cost 10/- or 20/- for the manufacturer, they should have provided a basic mobile cover\n* Audio - not that great even with Samsung headphones..listening to music won't be a great experience even if you enable dolby or whatever the feature it has got\n* Screen size - 6.7 inches would have been better\n* Bloatware - Too many bloatware..unnecessary and annoying\n\nOverall - It does a pretty good job. For 14k or below, just go for it..\n\nafter 3months of usage:\nPhone is good, got android 11 update as well..\nfew annoying things to be noted are\n1) during calls, the hold or record button gets enabled when the ear touches the sides of the pannels. I couldn't find a way to disable this on call menu. What I do is, put the phone into home screen and lock the screen as soon as I attend the call or when my calls gets picked\n\n2) Bloatware - Too many bloatwares and Galaxy store updates apps of its liking. So I disbaled Galaxy store\n\n3) Power cord - the length of the cord is way less than cords provided by any other brands. Apart from cutting cost by providing an inferior Exynos processor samsung wanna cut cost by cutting the cord's length.\n\n4) Exynos is no where near SD\n",1,,,,,,,,

In 6 month the screen started showing a purple patch, which grew to cover half of the screen in a week's time. The touch do not work on the purple spot on screen.\nThe point to note here is, I never dropped the phone or any liquid exposure.\nI took the phone to samsung service center and they refused to replace screen for free even though the phone was in warranty period. They claimed there is physical damage, which I could not find from naked eyes.\nAnyway I would say no because of the quality and after sales service.\nI wasted about 17k for this phone.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Rs 8000/- phone redmi was connecting to internet without any issues and this phone was not. Also it was observed that voice will be heard after 5 seconds of call getting connected. This happens quite some times. Sound output is less both in speaker mode and in earpiece mode. I didn't expect so many issues with such reputed brand.

Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.\nAlways on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.\n\nBattery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.\nFew hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)\nI am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.\nCharging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%\n(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)\n\nPerformance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.\n\nCamera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.\nAttached some sample shots.\n\nMacro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.\n\nWide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.\n\nSelfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.\n\nVideo recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!\n\nSummary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!\n\n(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt.

The battery lasted over a day with moderate to high usage, including surfing, watching YouTube videos, using Spotify and making two long calls. It took me 2 hours to charge the phone from 20 to 100%, which is decent considering that the charger is a 15W one. The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it. The processor is also great and it has been able to handle moderate levels of multitasking with ease. The display is bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is really good. Overall, it checks all the boxes, and makes it a true tool for the user.\n\nI would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a decent budget phone. In this range it is definitely the mega monster that it claims to be.\n",0,,,,,,,,

After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.\n\nNow, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.\n\nFor some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.\n\nCamera id descent for thus price range, won't say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.\n\nSamsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't make any difference.\n\nAny body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.\n",0,,,,,,,,

But trust me it's useless. Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing. Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc. Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy.

I'll be very quick to support my claims:\n\n1) Camera :- I do not find the rear camera to be 64MP, nor the front to be 32MP. Image quality is not appreciable, given the images shown in commercials. Wide angle images seem to be a little distorted/stretched from the edges.\n\n2) Battery: I don't find the phone's battery 'up to the mark'. That cinder block battery takes around 2 hours to charge from 15% to mere 65%. So. that's annoying especially when fast charging is being advertised everywhere. Also, if you use this phone just like any normal phone, you'll end with around 20% at 8-9 pm. I guess, this tower-sized battery has been given just to support this big device. Nothing more nothing less. No doubt, it's not a 'monster!'.\n\n3) Size:- Gone are those days when you could find a phone within this price change that actually fits in your pocket! I mean literally! The phone is big for hands as well as the pockets. After a few days, you'll find it more of like an annoying piece of plastic ruining your day to day activities.\n\n4)Speaker:- The speaker (main) of this device again falls behind mark. If you are used to watching movies/shows on this big screen of phones, the speaker falls behind miserably. The sound is not even loud or crystal clear.\n\n5) Authenticity issues:- With just two thin stickers joining the two boxes, this is perhaps the biggest issue.\n\n6) Weak sensors: The portrait to landscape mode shift takes 5 to 10 seconds!!!\nAll in all, the phone was not at par with the price paid. The only thing I loved was the screen refresh rate.\nSo, it's a NO-GO for me.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Coming to the looks, yes it looks classy and expensive phone in a very moderate budget(the back panel is slippery, you will have to buy a back cover, you can see the cover appearing in the uploaded pic 100 rs. cover from a local shop (which is otherwise rs. 250+ online) with sleek cutouts and made for m31 only, so go for local shop only for back cover and screenguard.\n\n2. For those complaining camera quality, I think they did not do enough research before posting, it has a decent camera with multiple modes and you will have to activate 64 MP quality manually under camera settings aspect ratio (shown in pic) which was otherwise disabled to save phone memory.\n\n3. FingerPrint reader works as a charm with once in a 50 miss.\n\n4. Coming to the battery life what I have experienced till now is 1 and a half days when 100% charged with youtube of 5-6 hours, 2 hours of calling and watching a 1.5 hours movie on Amazon Prime video app.\nWill update if any degrade noticed,\nCurrently satisfied with battery.\n\n5. If you are confused between Samsung M31 and M31s, go for M31(you will save 2,000 rs.).\nEach and everything is same in both- specially processor and camera and if you think about Single take Camera Feature in M31s,\nBingo! , you will get it in the OTA update right after unboxing M31.\n\nOverall it's a total value for money.\n\nPlease click Helpful if you like the review.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .\n3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .\n4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .\n5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .\n6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .\n\nCons :\n\n1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .\n2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely.

But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.\n• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.\n•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.\n• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.\n\nPros\n•Samsung is known for their Super Amoled\nScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.\n•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.\n•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.\n•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.\n\nSo overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using social media...\n\nIf you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....\n",0,,,,,,,,

I use the phone for light gaming, YouTube, music on BT headphones, occasional long phone calls or video calls, some quick photos from time to time.\nIn my usage I didn't have any problems yet.\n\nCan get through the entire using 60-70% of battery with 7+ hours of screen on time.\n\nLight gaming is not a problem gets a little warm if using for some time.\nHeavy gamers don't go for this one, specially if you are concerned about throttling or frame drops, otherwise it is okay for regular games.\n\nPrimary camera is decent no big issue after updates, I only use primary camera. Wide angle is usable but not the best. I never used macro and depth.\nSecondary camera is also good at this price. Note : I disable beauty modes etc, those just make your face look weird.\nAttached a same photo in regular mode, not 64 ( blacked out serial number intentionally 😃 ). I'm sure that image will compress when uploading but believe me it's good.\n\nAudio call and network quality is good. No Bluetooth or wifi issues. Dolby Atmos is good to change the equalizer to your taste.\n\nDisplay has awesome contrast and colors and you can change settings for it.\nPlease do buy a case, the back plastic is a fingerprint magnet. Also you don't want to drop test the beautiful screen. Build quality good, but it is not that great when compared to Nokia or Samsung S or A series.\n\nComing from stock android the OneUI is good, it takes some time getting used to it. Miss the haptic feedback on keyboard. Do opt out of the marketing stuff in the initial setup to get the best experience. Some oneUI features are really awesome.\n\nOn software I would caution users to read online reviews before updating the Samsung updates. Most of the updates bring good features, read before install and you will be okay.\n\nHope this detailed review is helpful to new buyers.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained even in bright sunlight you see the display pretty well. The viewing angles are also good. No color changes when views angles gets changed. No queries from my side.\n\n2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla Glass 3 protection at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared to other phones of this budget section( of course thanks to massive battery).\n\n3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.\n\n4. Front Camera: Performed well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed texture on the face(just turn off the Beauty effect) and the one of the main function is that during calls, front camera is used as ambient light sensor to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's all about the habbit that is to be developed with time.\n\n5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played musics of high frequency and bass, at high sound it losses it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.\nThe ear piece sound quality is exceptionally great.\n\n6. Rear Cameras: The design of Quad Cameras impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.\n\nThe 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice the overall quality of normal 16MP photos are a bit rich as compared to 64MP photos as capturing image in 64MP and rendering it to 16MP increases it's quality.\n\nThe Live Focus is impressive and the blurring edge of the photos is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial lighting. I am satisfied very well.\n\nThe wide camera Performed pretty well and got satisfactory results.\n\nI am bit disappointed with the Macro Lens that didn't performed well, however in multiple shots I got a good quality macro photo. But using main camera for macro photos gives great results.\n\nThe LED was pretty good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally well.\n\n7. Battery: Yes the massive 6000mAH battery is worth called massive. I got the screen-on period of 10hours in a single charge. On using it in a average way gave me around 30 hours of backup.\n\n8. Performance: I experienced buttery smooth performance in using it in above average usage. But I will say that you can get a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance as it doesn't got a gaming processor.\nBut in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.\n\nThe only visible difference between M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement of secondary mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which is on the right in M30s\n\nAs a average user 60Hz display is okay for me, I didn't experienced any frame drops.\n\nOverall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.\n\nI will reccomend this product for average users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Just GO FOR IT.,"\n Bought the M31 around 2 weeks back. Extremely satisfied with the perfomance.\n Battery life is amazing, getting more than 1 full day with extra-heavy usage (usually my phones last half a day on a heavy use day). With moderate usage, it can go up to 2 days on a full charge. Video edits, image edits, hours on Facebook and whatsapp, around 2 hours of calling per day. Camera is outstanding with sunlight and in medium light conditions. In very low light, the camera is average, but definitely not bad. Macro shots are amazing. 64mp option for images create crystal clear images of upto 20-25 mb size!!. There has been no lag whatsoever with multiple heavy app usage yet. Fingerprint reader is superfast and has taken more than one try to unlock only a couple of times so far, that too when my finger was moist. Build quality seems really good, i use the phones with care, but my activities are usually rough, and this phone hasnt failed. Amoled is amazing. I am using an amoled screen for the first time, and it is truly stunning. Actually its been a long time since i have been looking for all the options that M31 has offered, and very few other phones have all these (6000 mah battery, amoled screen, stunning camera with slow motion and superslow motion)packed into one, and that too at a really attractive price.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ✌️ continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs\n,0,,,,,,,,

There are certain things i'd like to mention.\n\nPros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.\n\nCons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.\n\nApart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy.\n We as youngsters are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.\nI am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with an Exynos 9611 SoC and gets 6GB of RAM. It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.\n64MP + 8MP + 5MP + 5MP rear camera | 32MP front facing camera 16.21 centimeters (6.4-inch) FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with 2340 x 1080 pixels resolution, 404 ppi pixel density and 16M color support Memory, Storage &amp; SIM: 6GB RAM | 64GB storage expandable up to 512GB | Dual SIM with dual standby (4G+4G) Android v10.0 operating system with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor 6000mAH lithium-ion battery 1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase Box also includes: Travel Adapter, USB Cable, Ejection Pin, User Manual Fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor | Dual SIM (nano+nano) with dual standby and dual VoLTE , Dedicated Sim slot;Widevine L1 certification for HD streaming\nSamsung is my unprecedented favorite brand and I never used any other brand. This phone is amazing in every terms !\nAmazon is always giving their best when it comes to product quality and delivery time.\nBuy For\n• Splendid camera set-up\n Mammoth battery life\n Vivid display\n Huge in-built storage\nVerdict\nSamsung comes up with the upgraded variant, Samsung Galaxy M31 to line-up the segment of M series. Featuring the advanced version of its forerunner, the mid-range smartphone has an impressive quad-camera set-up, powerful device maker's chipset with 6GB RAM, large battery capacity with fast-charging functionality and an abundantly expandable in-built storage space. The phone is a viable option for users who are looking for a decent performer at a budget.\nUpgraded Variant of M30\nDisplay and Camera\nThe Samsung Galaxy M31 128GB gets a Super AMOLED display size of 6.4 inch (16.26cm) along with a screen resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403ppi pixel density, which adds brilliantly vivid streaming in the device. The bezel display of the device features a waterdrop notch design to showcase the front camera set-up. For enhanced security, the HD+ display comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass v3.\n\nGalaxy M31 features a quad-camera set-up with a 64MP primary camera supported by an 8MP ultra-wide-angled and two similar 2MP lenses. The camera features of the handset comprise of 8x Digital Zoom, HDR, panorama and portrait modes. Accompanied by an Exmor RS sensor, the front fascia sports a 32MP shooter embedded in the waterdrop notch design of the device.\n\nPerformance and Battery\nThe Galaxy M31 is powered by a 2.3GHz Octa-core Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 chipset.

In terms of connectivity, the Galaxy M31 offers 4G Volte network, dual-SIM, USB Type-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and A-GPS with GLONASS.\nDesign\n• Decent looks and build quality - very similar to the Samsung Galaxy M30s, with a a unibody polycarbonate design, and glossy finish on the back panel - the only major difference is the camera module which now packs a fourth camera\n• The plastic body keeps the phone feeling relatively lightweight at 191 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6000 mAh battery\n• It also feels great to hold with a seamless curved panel that meets the display up front\n• Modern, Infinity-U front - bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin - you still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great\n• Fingerprint sensor at the back is easy to reach\n• The power button and volumes are quite flush with the frame which means they lack that tactile, clicky feel\n• Design feels a bit dated and underwhelming, there is no spark in Galaxy M31's design as we see in other brand's phones like Xiaomi and Realme\nDisplay\n• Gorgeous, 6.4-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with excellent viewing angles, and brightness levels - easily one of the best displays in the price bracket\n• It also comes with ""Widevine L1"" certification, which helps stream content in crisp HD resolution\n• Blacks are deep on the AMOLED display, which looks good with Night mode enabled\nSoftware\n• Samsung's OneUI is today one of the more clean, refined Android UIs that's especially well optimised for large displays like this\n• One UI also brings in other useful stuff, like a System-wide Dark mode (which turns the background completely black, and looks great on the M30s' AMOLED display), and Always On Display option\n",0,,,,,,,,

Also the fact that they do not offer mic is very annoying too. They are really bad for calls and pubg gameplays . Also they have low sound levels as compared to other headphones and a base which is next to none. Also not comfortable for long time. Noise cancellation is just very very little.

I bought it for ₹570/- . Sound quality is excellent and bass is really good. I'm a huge music lover, I have listened to Sony and Boat ...but If you want to feel the music, if you want to get the rythm of the song, if you want to get the original quality of the song when it was recorded...then Go for this Sony product. Boat basshead 900 has more bass but the sound is coarse , you can't feel it,voice is not that soothing. But this Sony headphone makes allows to hear every bit of sound very clear at this price range. It would be better\n1.if black option were there\n2. band was of metal\n 3.more cusion were there\n. One thing more, it has gold coated jack that is also a big plus point for Sony.\n\nSound 5/5\nBass 4.5/5\nOverall quality 4.5/5\n",0,,,,,,,,

The price is Slightly very low so we can not expect anything more.\nAll I Dont like in it is its Uncomfortability the cusion is too low to get a better grip and comfortable fit.\nallthough you can go with any other brands and can buy something else like boat headphones which is good in bass and also better than this invest some more and get some more.\nSony Audio Is a very good and excellent company but only if you invest some more on it.\nAnd Now it is upto you.\nThankyou.\n",1,,,,,,,,

LEGS start bending and gets displace even if SMALL! amount of pressure is applied to the top (mobile holder). Legs are too weak.\nDo not expect that much from it as it doesn't feel that durable. Attaching a DSLR on it will be a mistake, it claims to hold DSLR but it starts cramping with mobile-only.\nIt is not that tall when fully extended and can only come handy to record videos while you are sitting. If you are 5 feet or above then you can never come in frame of your mobile while standing.\nBest if you want to make unboxing videos on a desk or something below 3ft\nONLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING YOUTUBE/ TIK TOK.\nBut you can use it for mobile photography as it requires the mobile to be still.\n.\nPlease tap HELPFUL if it was helpful to you and BEST OF LUCK!\n",1,,,,,,,,

The tripod is very delicate\n2. When extended completely the tripod legs wobble\n3. The build is not strong. Thereby, even a little slant surface makes it fall to one side\n4. The joints of the tripod legs are loose and spoil very fast\n5. Did not even last a month. You may check out the pictures I added\nI would not recommend this product to anyone.\n\nSuggestions to manfacturer / seller:\n1. Have a strong build quality\n2. Take care of the tripod leg opening radius to the tripod height ratio when fully extended.\n3. Tripod leg joints need to be firm\n4. If the quality is good, wouldn't mind paying more for the product. Do not compromise on quality.\n",1,,,,,,,,

No complaints for what I got for the price I paid\nSwitching from a 7 year old Sony 21"" to a Mi TV 43"", the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable, it is in your face.\nI mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny. Even my JBL Bluetooth sounds better.\nThe image quality is just about suffer-able. Also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone, laptop, TV with much smaller screens, FHD on 43"" will give you a terrible experience especially with this TV that does ZERO anti-aliasing.I cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible. If you don't understand what I am saying, look at the curve of 'M' in Mi when the TV boots up.\nBefore buying this TV i had read many review which mentioned losing WiFi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full HD content. I myself noticed the same in one of my office TVs and attributed it to poor WiFi strength. But with this TV i can confirm that it is not the WiFi, I have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the TV. When I connect the TV to ethernet, I dont see any more youtube crashes. So the wifi card in the TV is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic.\nBoot-up time of the OS is not impressive either and takes ~60 seconds\n\nNow for the good parts.\nInstallation and configuration was super easy. In fact I did it myself in ~15 mins. My grandma looked like she could do it as well.\nThere is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source. So you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency TV cable. In my case I found it much more convenient to use my Jio set top box to stream online content in full HD (primevideo, youtube) than using Mi's android tv or patchwall\n\nVerdict\nThe image quality may be forgiven if you pair the TV with good home-theater audio, otherwise this TV is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms\n",0,,,,,,,,

It's awesome. The 32 inch HD ready model is an ideal size for HD channels as they generally are 720p.\n\nYou can see the attached pictures for estimating picture quality, the second one is from YouTube at 720p.\n\nFrom the experience I had at Xiaomi Service Center with my phone, I can gladly tell you can trust it's service.\n\nAfter the update, the sound quality is subtly improved.\n\nThe best thing about this is, you can even cast your laptop using chrome, I don't think others provide this application.\n\nAmazon Prime is soon to be supported and Netflix isn't. I can live with that.\n\nDon't worry if you don't find any music apps in play store. Just tell Google assistant what you wanna play and it will play in whatever app you want, be it gaana, Saavn or wynk.\n\nSo yeah, no complaints so far. I would advice you to use a stabilizer IF you are using government's electricity service.\n\nAnd yes, don't book your installation on Sunday even if it shows it's available, they are not.\n\nTo those who are saying you can't make AV or any of the HDMI as default. Go to APPS - Live TV, add this to favorites, so you can directly access cable from interface. Now in Patchwall whichever mode you will select, will be set as default when you open Live TV app from interface, there you go!\n\nGo for it!\n",0,,,,,,,,

MI is not ready to support repair under warranty as they are pushing the onus on us sighting physical damage. But I have uploaded the photo of tv without turning it on and there is no sign of any external damage. The crack can only be seen when the tv is on and inside the panel.\nI am very disheartened that this has happened after just two months seems there is no quality check is done.\n\nPurchased the tv few weeks back and found following\nPros: good picture quality with hdmi interface, nice design and lightweight, sound is above average at the tv price range, 3 hdmi and 2 usb interface. Yet to check usb interface.\nCons: software issues like AV interface suddenly disappeared and had to reset android to bring it back. One day sound disappeared and had to restart android to bring it back. The smart interface does not have very easy and large interface to work with.\nOverall value for money but with issues which they can easily fix as it mostly with software.\nI will back re-reviewing after few months of usage\n",1,,,,,,,,

I bought this Mi led TV 4C Pro one week ago.\n\nTalk about build quality it's made by plastic &amp; good enough at this price point. It's light weight &amp; design is almost similar to Mi LED TV 4A.\n\nPicture quality is not the very best but it's good. Resolution is 1366×768 means it is only a HD ready panel. I checked on tv upto 4k videos on YouTube &amp; full hd videos on USB drive was playing smoothly but after 720p no major difference in quality of video on higher resolution. I feel little bit better quality display in comparison of Mi LED TV 4A. One thing to notice on display that corners are little but darker when your screen is white. Overall picture quality is acceptable.\n\nSound output is almost same as Mi Led TV 4A. It comes with 10w×2 two speakers setup &amp; it is loud &amp; clear upto 70% volume. I feel little bit distortion on high volume but I say it is one the best the sound output in TVs in this price segment.\n\nNow talk software/os it runs on Android 8.1 &amp; Patchwall. Android gives you freedom to download tons of apps from play store which is already available on tv. You can set up your android smartphone with tv. Share your smartphone content to tv easily through Google cast because it comes with Chromecast built in. Youtube works flawlessly if internet speed is good. Patchwall gives lots of content from many online content partners some are free and some paid but it's good.\n\nTv comes with lots of connectivity features. Here is 3×HDMI, 2×USB, AV, 3.5mm audio out, lan port, Bluetooth &amp; wifi.\nTv comes with a bluetooth enabled 12 button voice remote which is very useful you can use is from any direction &amp; use voice command from dedicated mic available on remote.\n\nTable mount comes in box but you need to pay 399 for wall mount installation.\n\nOverall it is a value for money Smart LED Android TV by Xiaomi.\n",0,,,,,,,,

But the marketing and customer service after sales by MI provides assurance although this is a very affordabe low entry priced TV in Android market.\n\nThe setup of this fully featured Android TV is simple and effective and the pre installed apps works flawlessly. Although the video playback through wifi and chromecast even in high speed network had some playback issues in downloaded apps which is negligible if u dont install too many apps.\n\nThe best part of this MI TV is the remote which is simple and best for Internet TV users. Since its an Android based TV most people who buy this would essentially use more of the Internet content hence this remote which is simliar to Amazon Fire TV Stick is absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe only thing that needs some improvement is the Sound quality. No doubt that the speakers are loud but the voice clarity is not that clear having used to the other TV brands which cost thrice as much as this MI Android TV. For a start to start using Android fearures in a TV that too in this price segment its easily the best Android TV in the market current if u are willing to spend some money on a quality sound bar for better quality sound.\n\nBought it at a price of Rs. 12,499 without the instant discount on card payment. But if Rs. 1500 is reduced the price of Rs. 10,999 is an absoutele delight for every person who decides to but this TV with all those interesting features provided which works best as promised. Overall a must buy if u are looking for a secondary Android TV or if u are new to the android world. Sure no one would regret for the money paid thanks to Amazon and MI for coming up with this awesome product!\n",0,,,,,,,,

Alright let's move to pros and Cons...\n\nPros...\n1. Value for money.\n2. Looks great and is light weight.\n3. It's got both Android as well as Patchwall. And with a strong WiFi connection you won't need Cable or Dish antenna connection any more.\n4. For an average room the built in speakers are enough.\n5. Patch wall has a lot of free content to offer and when connected to your Android phone there is whole lot of possible things that you can do, being able to play Pub g on medium settings is my favourite.\n6. You can connect your pendrive to side load apps as well.\n7. trick: Side load thopp TV app to watch paid content for free.\n8. Voice command on Mi remote works as good as in any Android phone.\n\nCons..\n1. While the speakers are loud and clear with Android TV apps and Patchwall it somehow seems muffled up with Cable connection.\n2. Same applies with display. Normal SD connection cable picture quality is disappointing one needs an HD connection for better experience.\n3. WiFi range isnt very powerful had to shift my Mi WiFi router from Bedroom to Hall for a steady connection.\n",1,,,,,,,,

The TV did not fall on the ground and from outside there is no physical damage being observed. I have been told by the engineer that the panel inside has broken and this is not covered under warranty.

I am writing this review after using this machine for quite 2 or 3 months. It is making horrible noise during spin function, you literally have to rush and hold the machine as it's moving so horribly. Please don't buy Samsung products because they don't even bother to solve your issues after calling customer service so many times. The person came and test the machine with 4 clothes even after having 6.5 kg capacity. Then machine did not make noise at that time and they updated the issue as resolved and again same story the other day. Really frustrated with this machine and Samsung service.

But to all my surprise Sungsung Customer Care executives denied me replacement and said that it was not placed properly etc etc. Thereafter, when I contacted the local Sungsung Technical Team at Guwahati for replacement of the defective machine, the inspite of taking care of the right of the customer, had not given good response and instead of giving me replacement asked me to contact Amazon for replacement. Finding to good response from Samsung, I then contacted Amazon Customer care for replacement. Then Amazon showed good professionalism and arrange for an inspection of the defective washing machine and accordingly Amazon's technician inspected the machine and confirmed it's defectiveness. And on contacting Amazon Customer care, they quickly refunded the entire value after the defective products successful pick up. Amazon, in this matter showed great customer friendly attitude. Thanks a lot to Amazon. However Sumsunge response in this regard is pathetic. Never buy Sumsung products as they are giving defective products for sell. A big ZERO to Samsung and 100 to Amazon..\n",1,,,,,,,,

Keep the machine on hard surface, in such way, that it doesn't budge at all.\n2. Go through the booklet, coming with the product, meticulously, you may yourself install the product. You may also download the pdf from Amazon's page.\n3. If you do it on your own, the only problem you may face is to attach inlet pipe with the tap. There are three detachable parts at the mouth of the inlet pipe (go through the booklet) on the side of the tap. I bought a tap with two stopcock (see the picture) ---- one for washing machine and the other for normal purpose. I have also purchased longer inlet &amp; outlet pipes, as per my requirements, from Amazon (you may get 3 meter or 5 meter lengths of them). Remember, you will have to get everything ready (i.e. provision for electric and water line connection near the machine) before Samsung technician visits your home for demo purpose.\n4. Machine is so superb that it distributes laundry uniformly on its own inside the tub during its operation (rinse / spin), if not (not in my case till now), machine will signal and you may manually balance the same (go through the one page leaflet coming with the product).\n5. The noise produced by the machine is very normal with deep humming sound. In my video, the noise appears to be louder.\n6. Washing and drying quality is very good. I think, for four family members, at best 3 times washing in a week will suffice.\n7. There is a level mark L (low), M (medium) and H (high) inside the tub --- do not overlook for filling the tub with laundry.\n8. Do not mix heavy clothes with light ones for good washing purposes. For example, if you you wish to wash three bed covers, do it separately, and not mix with them with shirts, inners, etc.\n9. Preserve Amazon's voucher carefully, as Samsung technician told me 10 years' warranty on the motor, and any problem cropped up in future, that voucher will be needed.\n10. Only cons ---- consumes huge quantity of water, that I think, is necessary for any top loading washing machine, otherwise, keep electric and water connection on, then, press Power &amp; Start buttons in tandem, machine will work on its own and will signal for end, then goes off automatically, for taking out 90% dried laundry out of it.\n11. My Samsung technician is good enough to explain several functionalities of the machine and also advised on proper maintenance of the same.\n",0,,,,,,,,

We had booked this washing machine and it arrived well on time. Amazon has been amazing in handling the products and arranging for installation all within the mentioned time. However, when the installation guy came to run the machine it was found that the balancer was defective and he suggested we replace the machine. Since the replacement stock was not available we were advised to cancel the machine and we promptly got our refund back.\n\nHowever since the brand is reputed and we had quite liked the look of the machine we decided to purchase it again. Again Amazon had been super in delivering the product. This time when the product was opened it was found that there were large dents on the body which could not be corrected. We had no other option but to replace the product again.\n\nMy review is for mentioning how Amazon helped us both the times..they have been so efficient, polite and so prompt in their action. It was very very unfortunate to see how a reputed brand like Samsung was delivering such low quality products to customers without even running the quality check properly. Extremely disheartened by Samsung.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Clearly there is a confusion in the details provided on Amazon site itself. On further checking with Samsung, they have confirmed that the product comes only with 2 years additional warranty on motor.\n\nPrice : 5 star\nReceived the product for a effective price of 10.7k during great Indian festival sale. It's a competitive price for a product from Samsung Brand.\n\nProduct : 3 star\nOverall a average product. Water consumption is on a higher side. The wash cycle involves product rotating in clockwise direction for 180 degree followed by anti clockwise for another 180. In normal mode, the wash happens only for around 20mins which may not be sufficient at times and there is no other mode available to increase the wash duration. Also, since it's a 680 rpm motor, the drying is also not very effective.\n\nAmazon and Samsung Support : 5 star\nInstallation was provided on the same day as delivery. Samsung Support responded to the query on warranty within 24hrs and Amazon support was co operative in accepting the product return for the difference in product description.\n\nOverall : 1 star\nYou are not getting what you are promised with the warranty. Make sure you are ok with 2 years warranty before purchasing\n",1,,,,,,,,

The technician told us we just need to put one glass vinegar for auto tub clean every 6 months\n5. Before starting the cycle, the drum rotates for few seconds to determine the load and then selects the water level (1-5) automatically\n6. A top load without agitator and hence gentle on clothes\n7. Standard drying time is 9 minutes and monsoon mode with 15 minutes and 30 minutes extension are super\n8. Same day installation by the technician\n9. Very helpful customer support on phone\n\nCons:\n1. Machine has a magic filter inside which the technician told us needs to be cleaned everytime after use (This is little disappointing)\n2.

As the title says, I totally fell in love with it.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThis review is for those, who are confused regarding the hype of M50X. I personally did not like the sound signature earlier. But after a lot of tweaking with equalizer and with enabling spatial sound (Dolby Atmos for windows 10), I am slowly falling in love with these headphones. It requires time to get used to the signature of sound if you are hardcore bass lovers.\n\nSo here is my full review which I would like to break down by points :\n\n1) SOUND Quality:\n\nBASS 9/10: Excellent production of bass. After increasing bass levels in Equalizer, it just pumps right amount of bass and is very deep and punchy.\nMIDS 7 /10: Mids are okay, balanced. Vocals are crisp and bass does not overpower the mids.\nHIGHS 5 / 10: Awful. It's very bright. I had to lower down some higher frequencies in order to resolve my headache.\n\nI come from Sennheiser background where I had PX 80, PX 95, CX 175, HD 202, HD 203 and HD598 SR. I also have Sony MDR 550AP. So comparing to those, sound signature of ATH is different. If you directly plug in these headphones without configuring and tweaking equalizer as per your needs, then you would be disappointed, as I was on the first day of listening to these.\n\nI thought, maybe, I should try configuring properly. I googled frequency response and balanced equalizer as per my needs. I have uploaded my EQ settings. So below review is purely depending on my personalized EQ setting.\n\nNow, these headphone sound damn amazing, I could not believe the experience after enabling Dolby Atmos for Headphones (Windows 10 feature). It's brilliant. Even it sounds great on Windows Sonic spatial configuration. Just disable 7.1 virtual surround. Uncheck the box in sound setting. Games and movies sounds epic. High quality audio files have new dimension to it now. Especially A.R Rahman songs (Dil se and Jiya Jale recording in Berkeley University). If you love bass, these will definitely sound better than HD598. But if you love immersion and wider soundstage, no one can beat Sennheiser HD598 under 10k budget.\n\nHowever sound quality is very subjective, as many people prefer high bass, many prefer higher clarity. These headphones can be ""ADJUSTED"" according to your needs. Hence I can say, out of the box its not good, but it definitely has that capability to be the best if you give it proper attention.\n\n2) BUILD QUALITY 10/10 : Simply excellent. It feels premium. Very strong. It looks durable, many people have been using these for years. Although not sure about ear cups, as they wear out in one year or so.\n\n3) COMFORT 9/10 (Edited) : When I posted this review, I found it very difficult to wear these for long hours, but after 10 months of usage, the comfort level is far better now. I have used it for watching back to back movies, playing games for 4-6 hours straight without any issue. Although in warm weather, it may get a bit sticky. No issues in air conditioned room.\n\n4) NOISE CANCELLATION 6/10: Not that good. I can hear ambient noise. It reduces up to 50 percent. Best to listen in quiet environment.\n\n5) SOUND LEAK 10/10: Sound does not leak at all. Person sitting next to you will not be disturbed at all, even on high volume.\n\n6) Accessories 10/10 : Good carrying pouch, 3 wires as per different needs.\n",0,,,,,,,,

What that essentially means is that there's nothing better than the M50x under ₹20k. The better beyerdynamic ones are more expensive than 20k. Just friggin get it. I don't think with the increased price of the M40x (at the time of writing the review it's selling for about 9k) the M40x is a good value anymore. Also, get the brainwavz sheepskin pads. Stock pads are trash. Skip to the end for the scores.\nSidenote, amazon really ruined the packaging in the delivery process. On top of that, it was just lying there in the so-called “final destination” hub that’s like 5km from my home for 4 days. The amazon packaging as well as the M50x box got absolutely wet and wrecked. Really disappointed, Amazon (it was Amazon Transportation Services, mind you). This however is also a testament to the built quality of the headphones as they were in perfect condition despite the heavy beating the packaging received, and hence won’t be returning them. I just don’t have the time to wait another month for amazon to replace the thing. I need to get my work done.\n\nSOUND\n\nAlright down to business now. If accurate is the word you're looking for, you've come to the right place. The M50x has excellent reproduction and it's immensely revealing. More so than the M40x. The sound stage is wide for a closed back headphone. The major improvement over the M40x would be the excellent imaging which was quite mediocre in the M40x. Instrument separation is excellent as well. Even the most intricate producing trickeries that most headphones in this price point can’t even reproduce become crystal clear. If you’re upgrading from something cheaper or the dreaded skullcandy or beats headphones, you’ll be surprised how much you were missing out on. If frequency response graphs are anything to go by, M50x is supposed to be more flat compared to the M40x but to my ears, the M50x seem to have a very slight emphasis on the lows. I was surprised to see that Audio-Technica has done away with the foam sheets that they used to put in between the driver and the earpad and actually tweaked the driver design, which is a good thing. You don’t have to worry about the thin foam sheets while changing pads. Not having to rely on those is always a good thing. I didn’t notice any drastic change in the sound quality with the change in pads. Perhaps slightly better sound stage.\n\nBUILD AND COMFORT\n\n With the stock pads, the comfort isn’t anything to write home about. But it’s not bad. The pads are still pleather so they’ll last 2 years at most, though it does depend on how rough you use them. I already had the sheepskin pads from my M40x, which recently broke. Not the headphone’s fault. A certain person had borrowed them from me for a few days and he managed to break the thing somehow, at an age of 4 years. Rest in Peace, my dear M40x. Ah, right. The M50x. Excellent build quality, mediocre comfort with the stock pads. With almost any pad, it’ll get hot and sweaty during summers unless you’ve got everything air conditioned. The clamping force is a bit high but not uncomfortably so. It WILL loosen up a bit with time and become really comfortable. The folds and turns feel solid and the fold-in mechanism is satisfyingly clicky. The bottomline is I wouldn’t worry about it breaking on me unless I was a very rough user. If you’re one of those, you need some industrial construction equipment, not the M50x… or loads of cash to buy spare headphones. The top layer of the pleather does tend to wear off though, but it’s universally the case for all pleather. Not a big issue. Once it starts happening, just take half an hour to peel all of it off. The bare grey Velor kinda material looks way sleeker in my opinion.\n\nSCORES\n Sound: 9/10\n Comfort: 7/10, 9.5/10 with the pads replaced\n Build: 9/10\n Soundstage: 7/10\n Imaging: 9/10\n Separation: 10/10\n Sound isolation, passive: 7/10, 8/10 with the pads replaced.\n",0,,,,,,,,

But Headphone s cushion and band age horribly.,"\n First up, the sound quality is unreal. It's so damn good for video editing and even casual listening. I havent really used it with an amp yet but it's still great.\n\nIts been six years and its still chugs on.\n\nBut:\n1. It's very very VERY uncomfortable. These headphones are OK in air conditioned rooms. Even if the AC goes for about 5 minutes you ll start feeling the heat. The clamp force is terrible inspite of my best efforts to widen it by leaving it on hard surfaces all night.\n2. Build is... Average - the headphones feel just great is hand but the ear cushion started flaking in 6 months. Same with bottom of the headband. This inspite of me keeping it in bag as much as I could.\n3. Terrible for outdoor or relaxed use - if you want to use it normally on your bed or while travelling on public transport it sweats like crazy. Maybe a reason for the flaking. It's a bad headphone for casual listening so don't buy it if you want to do that.\n4. The accessories cost a bomb. The original earpads cost 2300. Even Brainwavs which is a replacement pair costs 1300. Thats the cost of a quality eaphone. So this is not pay and forget. Its expensive to buy and maintain.\n",1,,,,,,,,

I've come to conclusion that these perform well with all genres of songs.\nDon't get carried away with all the reviews which mention bass is extraordinary, bass and low end performance is present but not as much as the sony xtra bass series, when a song or an audio has a particular bass it is reflected perfectly and may be slight emphasised.\n\nI personally am a treble freak and the treble spark is amazing on these headphones, im hearing new unrecognized music nuances from my favourite tracks.\n\nWill post a review after few months of usage, since most people talk about better audio performace after burn in.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The M50x are amazingly good in showing you details which you've never heard in your favorite songs which you've listened to over hundreds of times.. I was amazed on how good they were in almost every genre that i played... The base always came out nice deep and punchy not overpowering in any manner and not for bass heads if you're thinking it pumps out sony xb kinda bass no it doesn't it gives you accurate bass reproduction that was meant to be heard without any effects... And yes these are amazing at that... Producing sound that was meant to be heard in that manner... Clear highs Mesmerizing mids and punchy bass.. Though out of the box it will not be as great but as time goes and the drivers get warmed up and adequately burned in the sound will slowly start to change towards betterment and will come out how it was supposed to be LEGENDARY. And if you want like really good base response from them for gym or to listen to edm and hard bass drop songs then i have an eq setting for that as well (photo attached) it will bring out that lovely basssssss with a few sacrifice in other tones but for edm its perfect (for me)... Just try it out through BLACKPLAYER from playstore and using these settings in eq... I hope you will love it!\n",0,,,,,,,,

They do need a bit of amplification otherwise a phone or pc can't give it the power it needs right off the bat.\n\nThe sound isolation is as it can be expected from no active noise cancelling cans and acceptable.\nHeadphones look sturdy and premium even though it's plastic\n\nNow the main part being the actual sound out of it, it needs a burn in time of 3 hours atleast but post that, it's absolute bliss. These cans have a flat sound sighnature so if you are looking for skull vibrating bass, steer clear. But if you want to listen to music as it was meant to be without any or minute sound sighnature change, look no further.\nGiven their flat sound sighnature, it's ideal for actual mixing and music production (my main purpose for them) but I do enjoy them for casual listening too. Crystal clear highs, well presented mids and a non over powering bass.\n\nThe extra cables are a welcome added bonus!\n",0,,,,,,,,

It was cold during that time so these provided a good snugly warm feel but soon i noticed that as time passed temp started to rise resulting in sweat during summertime. I have to take them off after 1 hr of usage and wipe sweat which is pretty inconvenient. I would also like to add the fact that my ears are big and due to that i can't wear them for long without having pain. If you have big ears just get extra pair of pads. Also i would like to add that you can not listen comfortablely if you are outside.\n\n2}SOUND QUALITY\nThe most important part!! If you are upgrading from 4-5 k(INR) range then you will feel considerable upgrade. Sound stange is not big everything feels like its ""in your head"" . Note that sound separation is good not sound stage. Now lets come to detail retrieval, highs are boosted which make them strike a bit hard in some tracks like edm which is boosted already for ""majority"" but if you listen to guitar acoustic tracks you are gonna love it. Mids are recessed and not warm in short mids lack energy. While sub bass is adequately ""boomy"". Bass near low mid region is tight and edm tracks sound great in that region. Using eq is highly recommended if you listen to variety of genres.\n\n3} PRICING\nI got mine for 8 k (INR) which was a steal if you are getting around that price go for them. They provide a good value for that price.\n\n4} EASE OF TRAVEL\nThis is the part where M-50x's shine real well. There foldable design provide great use during traveling. Moreover they are just 38 ohm so they can be powered using smartphone or laptop whithout need of buying portable amp. Also there are 3 cables provided which come hande time to time.\nIf you've made this far,\nThank You for reading\n(•‿•)\n",0,,,,,,,,

It is comfortable for even long hours of usage, I am happy with that.\n\nEarlier, I was using Sennheiser PX 80, I know it's not a fair comparison but that's what I was using :). So I heard a lot about audio-technica and watched so many review videos on youtube and decided to upgrade from my PX 80 to ATH-M50x. Considering the price of the device and the good reviews I watched on youtube, my expectations are sky high :) But in reality it is different, it is not that much of a big upgrade as I was hoping.\n\nI don't know much technicality here but I am thinking if I have a separate DAC/amp then the sound quality would have been more pleasing. Like everybody knows the source audio should also be very good if you are expecting a good sound quality, in India most of the music streaming platforms gives 320 kbps(as per my knowledge), I won't say that is bad, but if you are hoping that with these headphones you are gonna blow your mind with superior sound quality then, well I don't know, maybe you should try with FLAC and good audio setup( I think like separate DAC/amp etc.)\n\nSo finally the conclusion is, if you are a person who listens to music from your phone or laptop then think about the money you are going to spend for this and if you are okay with that, go for it!!\n",1,,,,,,,,

Unlike other studio monitors, we can use the short cable with phone.\n\nConnection of cable with headphones is great, twist to fit type, so the cable can't accidentally come out.\n\nGood quality leather pouch is provided.\n\nCons:\n\nAfter every use you have to remove the cable, so that it could fit in the pouch.\n\nIt feels like the sound is not neutral especially highs feel enhanced in certain types of music or songs.\n\nOverall, If you are a professional, go for it, if you are amateur, lower versions will do the job.\n",0,,,,,,,,

What you hear is almost a filter (the processing circuitry of a headphone) applied to the output (the audio signal from your device) when you listen to a song on earphones and headphones. If it's already tweaked to sound bass heavy, there's not much room left for other frequencies to surface.\n\nThis headphone almost reproduces the exact signal that it receives. Almost, because truth be told there are other contenders in higher price brackets that perform way better than this.\n\nGo for it if you still want crystal clear clarity and also want headroom for tweak-ability while you're at it.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Never have been disspointed with the delivery and if at all I was not happy with the product, support team of amazon would always help me out.\nSo this time too the delivery was smooth and on schedule.\nThe Sony service center team did call us but I had already installed the TV by myself as it was pretty simple. Service center team came to our house and delivered the wall mount panel and also they informed that they will do free mounting . I didn't require the mounting at that time.\n\nFinally about the product.\n\nDisplay, viewing angles and Sound quality is good. But would suggest people to get a good soundbar for good cinematic experience. (always recommended for any TV).\nThe TV comes with smart features. It has dedicated YouTube and Netflix button on the remote. It has apps like prime, zee, yupp, Eros now, etc. I want to install Hotstar app but not sure if it is possible.\nThe only issue is the smart tv interface is too laggy. I guess the RAM is not sufficient enough. Other than that playback happens super smooth which depends on a good wifi connection.\n\nSo for a 43"" TV 38k is a bit high considering Chinese competitors like one plus giving at a much cheaper cost. But I paid a premium for a non Chinese company, Sony, which is also a made in India product and I have not qualms about it.\n\nUpdate: one cannot install additional apps on any ""Smart TV"". It has to be an ""Android TV"" for any new application installation\n",0,,,,,,,,

BEST IN CLASS,"\n &nbsp;I have compared all available TVs in this category and price range. This one is the best option available in this segment, simply go for it.. If you are a fan of picture quality, then you can stop your search and buy this. it’s better than many of the cheap 4K TVs in this price range.\n\nSound quality is average, but it does the job for a normal size living room.. I am using a Bose sound bar and it gives awesome sound output from the HDMI ARC port. All latest sound bar can be used with this TV because it has an hdmi arc port.\n\nSony’s quality is always been top notch, but still built quality is not top class in this TV. Quality of plastic is average and fitment is flimsy. TV is made in India, power adapter is made in Indonesia, only the remote is China made..\n\nConnectivity is also seamless. WiFi stays connected whole day without any interruptions.\nYou won’t regret a Netflix HD plan with this TV, simply awesome clarity.\nAs of now I am very happy with the purchase. I would recommend this TV for anyone who loves clear picture.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Please read all the photo I posted it with proof. It will help you to identify fake or original just by inspection.\nIn my case 2 are fake and 2 are original in which one fake is not even in working condition three are working but I think 1 will fail soon.\nSimple advice Don't buy online so much cheating.\n\nLEGALITY : If seller tries to oppress the review by blocking or removing review I will take sufficient legal action court for fraud and oppression of customer voice as I have all the proof.\n,1,,,,,,,,

Of th 3 , 2 had okay brightness , 3rd very dim.\n\nSo I suggest it's better to pay little higher by going to an electrical shop , checking the product and then buying, instead of online.\n\nEven though you might end up paying 25/30 more . As this 3 pcs costed Rs. 523 (Rs. 174 each) in retail it might cost 200/225 at best.\n\nFinal verdict .

The ergonomics of mouse is really good it just fits perfectly in my hands the buttons on the mouse pretty good but two side buttons are really clumsy to click I have accidentally the button I don't want to click like 1/5 times the keyboard also doesn't have that clicky feeling it has a soft feeling the wires are really good they are braided and have gold plating on the male usb end ....overall a good deal but don't get your hopes so high ,the quality is good for the price you are paying you don't get to customise the RGB of individual key but you can try few zone lighting or u can turn the lights off but you cannot turn off the mouse lights\n",1,,,,,,,,

Both the keyboard and mouse have gold plated usbs and braided cables, so u don't have to worry about them tangling. The mouse has the same finish as the keyboard, and feels premium on hand. I don't know much about keyboard keys, but these feel way better than those 800Rs mechanical keyboards you get locally. The brightness and dpi have there own buttons on the devices.

Light as a feather. Needs to have some weight, some minimum weight.\n\n2. Airy Side buttons though they work have no feel. People who experienced these kind of buttons can tell, they don't last more than a few days and also you can't physically feel any click, absolutely zero tactile feel except for a very faint click sound.

Metal back plate will scratch your table.\n\nMouse Rating: 3/5 for this price.\n\nKeyboard:\n\nPros:\n\nFeel is somewhat mechanical.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Very elevated: The metal plate lies flat on table and keys are very elevated. It's insanely difficult to type keeping your wrist straight. While gaming there is zero wrist support. Wrist starts to pain in a few minutes. Carpel tunnel is guaranteed. See pics attached.\n\n2. The keyboard came very dusty and seems like used, see close up images attached.\n\n3. The RGB is only RGB not key backlight. What do I mean, light comes from the gaps but not from the letters on the keyboard. Meaning you cannot see illuminated ABC etc, only light from all around the keys but actual keys don't glow. See pics attached.\n\n4. There is no shread of ergonomics in the keyboard.\n\nKeyboard Rating: 0/5\n\nOkay mouse. Keyboard only good to hang as an RGB decoration.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Keyboard: 9/10, Mouse: 7/10, read to know why","\n The first impressions of both the keyboard and the mouse were awesome! I needed these for programming as well as gaming. Here's a more detailed overview on the products:\n\n1) Keyboard\n\nQuality (9/10): The top panel is completely metal built, which gives a really premium feeling to it. The keyboard is heavy enough to justify its quality.\n\nTyping experience (9/10): Really good. If you're coming from a regular keyboard then you're gonna love it. The keys are pressed softly and still gives good haptic feedback. It's a great gaming keyboard too, because if you need to press the same keys multiple times quickly, the keyup timing is really snappy which gives you an edge over regular or other gaming keyboards. Of course, the typing experience is not as great as fully functional mechanical keyboards but then, for the price, it's no less either.\n\nLooks (10/10): The keyboard looks super ergonomic, thanks to its metallic design, stylish edges, cuts and RGB lights. There is a set of 3 RGB lights combinations, you can switch among them using the dedicated light key. It also allows you to turn them off in case you don't want them on (during the day?).\n\n2) Mouse\n\nQuality (7/10): I don't know what's wrong with the mouse but the build quality somehow feels cheaper than the keyboard. I've used a Dragonwar mouse before (ELE-G9) and the quality was much better comparatively. However, the mouse is highy responsive and performs really well.\n\nExperience (8/10): The primary button clicks work amazingly well. There are 2 additional keys at the left side which can be used as 'Forward' and 'Backward' buttons. These buttons come really handy while browsing the web as you don't need to move your mouse to the navigation bar of your web browser to navigate. I feel the buttons are a little misplaced though, The 'Forward' button is okay, but to click on the 'Backward' button, I need to move my thumb a bit towards the palm. This wouldn't be the issue if the buttons were placed a little more towards the primary buttons. The fifth button helps in changing the DPI, and it works, serves the purpose just right.\n\nPrice for money?\nAbsolutely. I bought it for 1200, the price is of course higher than it's normal SP, but then it's expected to be so because of the current situations. Even if I'm not counting much on the mouse for durability, the keyboard alone justifies the price to be honest.\n",0,,,,,,,,

In keyboard the keys looks very premium even though it is membrane it looks like mechanical.

I have a big hand and most of the mice I used were too small. Now due to pandemic had to do my project and some work from home and my laptop touchpad is not comfy for me.\nLooked out for a cheap alternative and had HP M100 on my mind but it was a bit expensive so I went for this. Don't expect much. It takes times to install driver on first try and I thought it was not working when I first plugged in. After that it was working ok. The DPI is ok for the money. For gaming I just played GTA V and had no problems. It's a bit heavy and very good to hold for long time. Had pain while using small mice but with this there was no issue. The RGB is just two multi color LED at the front and back and no control over it. The mice camera uses IR led on the sensor so you can hold the DPI button for 5sec and the RGB will be off and still works the same. All the buttons are tactile and good.\n,1,,,,,,,,

The audio is clear&nbsp;but no bass. If you like music with bass than this speaker is not for you. It works like a charm with Bluetooth connectivity, but the sound quality gets distorted.\nIf you are seriously looking for a good quality sound output with some decent bass, then this speaker is not the one to consider. After giving this a trial...\n&nbsp;\nI bought Mifa A1 and to my surprise this was the one I was waiting for. Sound quality is superb and as the brand claims.. This speaker is actually water resistant. The build quality is great and battery backup is surprisingly good.\n&nbsp;\nThe main difference between JBL Go and Mifa A1\n&nbsp;\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound quality is very clear and powerful in Mifa A1. In JBL Go the sound starts cracking after you increase the volume.\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battery backup of MIFA is around 8 hours whereas of JBL is only 2&nbsp;hours.\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I poured 2 glasses of water on MIFA and it didn’t&nbsp;affected its operation on sound. For JBL, I can’t even think of doing so.\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BT version of JBL go is 4.1 whereas MIFA A1 has 4.2 version.\n5. Size and lookwise MIFA A1 is better then JBL Go.\n&nbsp;\n",1,,,,,,,,

This is a very small (exactly half the size of your 5 inch phone) and a poor quality device. The sound quality is extremely poor – even full volume on both your phone and the device will not make it audible outside of your home. I tried with multiple songs – both inside and outside – same result. For meetings and calls, this will still fall short of your expectation as you have to struggle to listen because the full volume doesn’t make the sound audible enough. At full volume, the sound cracks making it an overall poor quality device. Never buy this item. Go for a different one.\n",1,,,,,,,,

I have been using this for a month now, and I have experienced no such problem. The controller feels nice and sturdy and the vibrations are nice. The only thing I noticed is the right trigger is slightly less pressure sensitive than the left one. I noticed this in forza horizon and nfs payback.

Here are some things that I want to say about this:\n1. If your use case is to record video, for youtube or other purpose, your recording software (eg : OBS) will have a feature to mirror the camera. Use that if you are uncomfortable\n2. If your use case is webinar or attending classes or anything livestream, in many cases, the 'receiver' will see the image straight even though in the app t is flipped.

What does a beginner need?\nA budget-friendly mic yet gives the Best output. Right?\n\nBUILT QUALITY\n-Mic piece is very compact and handy to use. Given its compact size, it makes it convenient to carry anywhere you want\n-Cable/wire is extraordinarily long (6 meters). However, that's a great plus point. The long wire makes recording much easier and hassle-free\n-It has a Velcro for cable management. So, not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control.\n-It weighs around 100gms\n-There are no batteries included\n-There's a switch ON/OFF button. While recording You need to switch to CAMERA MODE (Don't really know why its written camera)\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n-My recordings have improved considerably with this Mic and I am loving it.\n-Just one complaint I have. It captures a lot of airflow meaning I can hear a lot of air from my mouth in the final output. Even If I record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance I can hear my breathing sounds.\n-Sound quality is loud enough and crisp.\n-It does capture my room's ceiling fan sound. So, I can hear that-- whoosh-- sound in the background when I am plugged into my earphones.\n-I record with the AC on and keep the fan switched off.\n\nAlso, It comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safe (yay).\nSo, finally Best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Read this full and i may help you clear your dilemma. If you need in depth review i have a review video on youtube. go to youtube . com / mobiletechpoint or search for ""mobile tech point Boya M1"" and you will find the review video. Audio for the Entire video has been recorded with Boya M1.\n\n1. I bought Boya M1 for 800 rupees. So this is a great pro mic for the price.\n2. first thing we notice is that the cable is 6 meters long which is super lengthy. So You have to be good in cable management. It is nice to see that battery unit is made of metal. If you use the mic with smartphones you don’t need a battery because the mic draws the power from the phone. But in case of dslr, you need to switch to camera mode. Good part of this mic is that it can connect with smartphones, tablets, pc, dslr’s and external audio recorders like zoom h1n. That’s pretty awesome right?\n3. For the price we pay, this mic gives you excellent quality audio. Having a 6-meter cable can be an advantage or disadvantage, it depends on how you look at it. If you are using the mic with external recorder you don’t need a 6m cable, but if you are using the mic with a dslr camera and if you want to move around, it gives you all the freedom. The other only concern that you need to be aware of is, since there is no battery indicator you might want to carry an extra battery. If you are going to record something important which you don’t want to miss at all, put in a new battery and you will be fine.\n4. If you are into audio recording, then Boya M1 lavalier mic is a must have. Even if you have an external audio recorder or a condenser mic, get this mic as well. I am sure this will come in handy at some point of time.\n\nIf you have any doubts, post a comment on my youtube video i will answer your query. Thanks. Buy this!\n",0,,,,,,,,

I bought this Boya Mic to increase the quality of the recording and it does what it says. The voice quality is very good. Build quality is above average. The mic can be used with DSLR cameras. The mic has control panel attched to the cable which is powered by a LR series cell. You can switch between camera and mobile by a button. Overall the mic is great in terms of value for money and voice recording quality.\n\nCons:\n1. The cable is extremely long and tangles very easily.\n2. The standard camera app may not support external mic so you can download third party app like open camera.\n",0,,,,,,,,

But not so good for the price.,"\n &nbsp;Hi, I read the other reviews of this mic on amazon, YouTube. Mostly all are good so, I decided to buy it.\nFirst time, an already opened box was delivered, so I asked for replacement. Amazon quickly replaced my product and I received a packed one this time.\n\nThis mic is not at all good for the price. The sound recorded is bad and low quality. It appears to be recorded on cheap quality mic present in earphones. My normal Logitech USB headset mic is working better than this.\n\nAbout noise cancellation:\nYes it is cancelling the noise. But it is very harsh. During noise cancellation, it also reduces the quality of original voice. And thus we get a low quality voice. Unfortunately there is no option to turn off noise cancellation.\n\nRecommendation:\nIf we want quality, I would suggest go for a good quality headset. It's voice would be clearer than this.\n\nCons:\n- Very harsh noise cancellation, which reduces quality of actual voice.\n- 20 feel cable is so long. (it is both a pro and a con)\n- A little on heavier side\n- Voice quality is not good.\n\nPros:\n- 20 Feet cable\n- Comes with 5.5 adapter to plugin into amplifier and other instruments\n- Build quality is amazing\n- Comes with a clip and cushion.\n- Comes with a small pouch.\n- Can be used on a camera.\n- Noise cancellation\n\nI've decided to return the product.\n",1,,,,,,,,

I got delivery of this on 24th of June. I am writing this review very sincerely and truthfully that this boya stopped working literally after a week of use. In a week I barely used it for a day or two and I packed this boya in its cover. When after a week and when I got to know that the return policy has already got lapsed on 4th of July, I thought it could be power button problem.... but on replacing power button with new one I learned that it was not a problem of power button but my boya had literally stopped working and I was helpless cause I missed my return date as per return policy. I would be much thankful if amazon can look into this matter with a genuine concern. Plus I haven’t used it on rough and tough basis. I have cared much of this boya Mike. Kindly look into this matter. My review is not for defaming your product. My review is for expressing my bad experience. You Mike could be best for many but I am suffering from this bad experience.

No QR code though! Original or not? But it WORKS.,"\n I needed it for my youtube videos, so i bought it!\n\nAt first i was very doubtful whether it was an original product or fake because i got it for 800+ Rs.\n\nI watched a lot of youtube videos about boya mic because at first it didn't work with my phone camera or voice recorder, and i got to know that this usually happens and that you have to download some other apps. So i did, and it worked!\n\nAlso, there were a lot of videos where the original or the fake boya mic had QR code in it, but mine did not have any! So i was anxious about that too. Instead what i had was ""coat the boya logo on right with water, they disappear"". It did disappear when i coated it with water.\n\nHowever in the original boya website i didn't find this water coating thing.. but I'm just hopefully happy with the product because it worked. I even made a 'sweet toasts - ASMR video' on youtube, you can check it out for the noise and all.\n\nHope it helped. Thankyou.\n",0,,,,,,,,

It do works well with phone and cameras...! But one thing you must be careful while purchasing is tht it definitely doesn't provide any kind of noise cancellation so if you r think to buy it for vlog or outside recording it may disappoint but you can treat the voice by editing it...so overall I'm completely satisfied and this product works very well...it'll record your voice very perfectly...!\n,0,,,,,,,,

It is better than non-battery mics but still not good for voice recording. I tried with my desktop it is giving some hmm sound (however that could be my motherboard problem), I tried with a USB sound card the clarity is better but the strengh is very weak. (I swithed on battery as for computers it does not work without switching on the battery). being disappointed I bought a Behringer U-PHORIA UMC22 audio interface (about 6000 rs) and connected though it but there is no improvement in sound throughput. If I increase the mic volume to 100% in behringer and 100% in computer then I get better throughput (bigger waves in audacity) but the recording is useless because of extreme noise. I connected to my android phone, the quality is slightly lesser than my inbuilt mic. However, it is working alright with my laptop (atleast better than non-battery mics) hence I am giving 2 stars.\n",1,,,,,,,,

More importantly, I didn’t get any dead pixels, been 2+ months now.\n- Please ignore comments wrt backlight bleed. Most of them are needlessly hyping the issue and are woefully ignorant of the manufacturing process of the monitor. In day to say usage it will not affect you at all.\n-32 inch and 2k gives you a lot more screen real estate. You can fit more windows without it being too small. This is great for WFH.\n-This is VESA mount compatible, 100x100\nAn excellent monitor that I would recommend to anyone for WFH, especially to budget conscious customers.\n",0,,,,,,,,

If you learn some basic techniques you can click amazing shots with D3500. I got a well packaged camera in two days for decent Rs. 26500.( cheaper than dealer’s price) When combined with Capture NXD free download, Power of RAW files can be put to use. 18-55 mm lens is not a great one, but is a good starting point. Having learnt some basics I miss the ability of the camera to shoot at high aperture. Unfortunately the kit lens does not go beyond f/5.6 in M mode ( and I look forward to add a f/2.8 prime 50 mm soon). However lenses can be purchased for a bargain from dealers directly.\nAfter theee months of usage : Have shot some awesome images with silhoutte. As I learnt more about photography I realise it’s 70 % of how you use the camera settings and the rest is about the lens.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Awesome machine for capturing memorable moments - specially who are beginners and are planning to buy a new camera to start but getting confused - I would not say much - just look at the shots that I took and uploaded here from my camera and you yourself will come to know what I am trying to say as there is a saying ""A Pictures Speaks Thousand of Words"" (Please note- all of these uploaded pictures have taken from its kit lenses itself - I didn't use any prime lens for these blurry effects).\n\n2. I don't want to go deeper into the technicality here - I would simply recommend all to buy this camera if you are specially looking to have your Camera for general photography purpose - not for commercial use. For Day to Day photography - it's A Jack Of All Trades!\n\n3. Easy to handle 5/5\n\n4. Picture Quality/Sharpness wise - 5/5 :)\n\n5. For Beginners - just start with these two lenses first as this is fine enough - but down the line if you feel then go for other lenses such as Prime 50mm.\n\n6. Try to shot via Manual Mode/A/S/P Only (An advise for beginner only) - First start with the Auto Mode - Learn &amp; Experience it, then go with the advanced level then you will enjoy the true performance of the machine :)\n\nAt last, I would like to end by saying - Don't confuse with any other machine especially when planning to buy a beginner level camera - buy it with closed eyes :)\n\nThanks,\nParikshit\n",0,,,,,,,,

Overall a pretty good buy for the price.\n\nThe oven arrived with a dent on top even though the packaging was excellent. It came inside three cardboard boxes. We didn't return it because there was no guarantee that the next oven would come in a better shape.\n\nNext time though I'd go for a more expensive brand that has a sturdier construct and sturdier components. Maybe agaro will make one like that with a crumb tray, sturdier grill rack and two trays etc.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The accessories are not made of stainless steel but iron and getting rusted after first water wash. Definitely they will not last long. On ther side the otg main unit is cost effective for this price and worth buying. All three knobs are totally mechanically operated and doesn't need any progammed circuit.\nBut here point to be noted that the Otg cabin had got more than two big dents when delivered. The brand box was not enough strong to bear the transportation load. Amazon should take proper attention over this matter.\nSo here my positive rating refers only to the Agaro Otg main unit and nothing else.\nNote- product made in China\n,0,,,,,,,,

I bought redgear cloak in September 2019 for ₹899. Its a very good headphones no doubt but but but , every coins has its down sides. So first let me share my good experience about these headphones. I mainly bought it for gaming like pubg , cod , minecraft etc. The build quality for 900 rs headphones is much much better than most of other existing headphones in the market. The quality of RGB is amazing but the effects are random you can't control RGB. Another good thing is you got a volume controller on headphones itself. it's also got a 3D sound effect. Now let's talk about the downside , the sound quality : the sound quality isn't best enough its just average + my headphone's right side driver was producing very low sound volume which is very annoying. Secondly you need a Audio + mic splitter for using it on mobile which cost you extra bucks. The last thing i faced with this issue is its Audio jack stopped working after almost 7 months of use and i didn't get the replacement yet because of the ongoing lockdown. Hope redwood interactive will replace my unit as it is under 1 year warranty. After my opinion headphone is about okay okay and I'm rating 3 stars for it.\nPros\n1. Beast build quality.\n2. Aggressive pricing.\n3. Damn good RGB.\n4. Eardrum cushioning.\n5. Auto adjustable headband.\n\nCons\n1. Low quality audio jack.\n2. Unbalanced volume.\n3. No 3.5 mm jack.\n4. Too big for small ears.\n5. No RGB controller.\n",1,,,,,,,,

But due to no damage to product I didn't returned it.\nNow about this product, is actually good even it's imported from China it's distributed n marketed by Indian company Redwood's Interactive based in Mumbai.\n1. For gaming if your compared it with other headphones in same price category it is good but not so loud. While gaming if your game or hardware can output more audio then it's good cause this headphones can go more louder with amplification.\n2. As I said audio is good but not loud for 2.1 stereo sound. But if you are watching any 7.1 audio channel video then it's really feels good.\n3. For comfort I have used it for more than 4-5hrs with allgrown hairs(thanks to Lockdown) n didn't feel any problem as cushioning is good and comfortable. Also earcups are large n deep so you don't feel any pain + it feels light weight.\n\nAs per price to performance ratio this is perfect headphones with RGB.\n\nLet me know if any one have questions regarding it.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Plastic ear cups, huge cushion, metal frame, RGB Logo, Red colored mic head!! Loving it!\n\nSound: Sound worths Rs 899! Good enough Bass and Treble. Loudness also worths its price. There is controller on the backside of the left ear cup. Controller adjustment is nit so satisfying but it is negligible as we an ootion in your PC or Laptop to adjust volume!\n\nMic: I hope you are not finding a noise cancellation enabled mic in the budget of Rs. 1000. Yes, it does not have such noise cancellation! But if your celling fan is running and you are attending a live meeting (Classes, Seminars..) in that case it would not fetch that fan sound. But in case of recording it would.. slightly!! Just a basic mic!\n\nConnectivity: It has 3 ports. Two Trs connectors (Speaker &amp; Mic Separate) and one usb to power up those RGB lights. You have an option to uplug the usb if you don't want lights. No need of usb connection to get sound and record audio.\n\nOverall it is a great purchase!! Once it was out of stock for 3-4 months later it was available for 899, then i awaited for more 3 months for price drop!! Waiting for 799!! Alas!! This does not happened!! Then bought it for 899!\n\nGo for it! You won't regret!\n",0,,,,,,,,

It has 1 Gigabit Ethernet (GE) input and 4 Gigabit Ethernet (GE) outputs; so, it can deliver the FTTH speeds accurately. With my Hathway Gigabit connection, I am getting a speed of 900 Mbps directly on the Ethernet, however there is still a loss of (more than) 100 Mbps, which you will not see on high end Cisco or Siemens modems/switches.\n\nI am getting up to 250 Mbps (internet) over 2x2 MIMO on Wireless AC on 5 GHz band (not 800 Mbps as advertised). May be multiple devices could get similar speed to yield a combined speed. My Wireless N speed on 2.4 GHz band is 40 Mbps; no much magic there. Not sure where that 300 Mbps cap advertised is hiding away.\n\nHaving said that, 200 Mbps on Wireless AC and 900 Mbps on GE is not at all bad for a price range of ₹2500. Plus it has 4 robust antennas for wireless delivery, MU-MIMO and Beamforming. It is unlikely to get such range of premium technologies and features at this price range along with almost all standard technologies like port forwarding, dynamic DNS etc.\n\nQoS and USB are not supported on this device. I would have been happy if it had both. In short, it is the best router out there with GE for this price range.\n",0,,,,,,,,

I have been using TP Link's Wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice. Eventually I settled for the C6 as the A6 offered no additional features and C80 and higher had a significantly higher price.\n\nAnyhow this is my initial review, which I will update if anything changes -\n\nBuild - Decent Quality. It's entirely plastic but looks durable. The shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you won't be handling your router everyday. It is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces. Antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nSetup - A bit tricky, this one. I'm on a Static IP FTTH connection so I assumed juet inputing values (IP, Gateway, Subnet, etc) will do the trick. However, it did not. Had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the Primary DNS. From experience I believe there was a MAC lock involved which they unlocked during the call but I can't be sure. Anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up. This isn't TP-LINK's fault.\n\nWhat is their fault is that MAC spoofing doesn't seem to work. So if your ISP isn't responding you may be stuck.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nRange and Signal Strength - Both are miles ahead of my 3C. I have a three storied house with thick 45-year old brick walls. Even on the third storey (with router on the ground floor) I could get a signal. Not possible with my 3c. Of course it's the 2.4GHz one and not 5Ghz but it's there.\n\nSpeed wise 5GHz is the king snd everyone knows that. Within the room and in the next room it works pretty good. Beyond that 2.4GHz seems to work well.\n\nOne grouse I have is that ""Smart"" Connection isn't good. Smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range. But with Smart on my adapter (from the same brand) gave miserable 560Kbps speeds on a 130Mbps connection. This with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed.\n\nSeparating the two bands by turning off Smart resulted in a huge improvement. 2.4GHz gives up to 80 Mbps in the same room while 5Ghz gives the full 130Mbps. One floor above I get 30-40Mbps. On the second floor it falls to 10-12Mbps.\n\nSo the antenna and radio are great, but the software needs to be improved.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nBells and Whistles - The router boasts of MU-MIMO and beam forming. Turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10% on the ground and first floors. Beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt.\n\nHaven't tried other features like VPN etc.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nConclusion - Compared to the 3C this router actually allows me to enjoy the FTTH speeds I pay for. The hardware is impeccable and sturdy. The software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the ""Smart"" department. That aside it's one of the most VFM routers under 3K for anyone with a 100Mbps connection or higher.\n\nOverall Rating - 4.5/5\n",0,,,,,,,,

The dual band 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz certainly makes a big difference as compared to the single band E900.\n\nFor reference, I'm currently on the 75 Mbps plan from ACT.\n\nWith the E900, my maximum download speed was topping off at 60 Mbps. However, with the upgrade in place, I'm now getting a consistent 70+ Mbps at all times (the speeds with the E900 used to fluctuate a lot).\n\nRange too, is pretty good on this router. Do bear in mind, however, that the range will take a substantial hit when connected to the 5 GHz WiFi as compared to the 2.4 GHz.\n\nFor those of you who're new to dual band WiFi routers like me, note that this will broadcast two separate SSIDs, one for each band, depending on which your speed and range will vary.\n\nThe setup process was an absolute breeze. Simply plug in the power and the internet cable and connect to either of the SSIDs using the password printed on the underside of the router on a computer or smartphone (computer is recommended) and open up your browser. The configuration page should open automatically. Follow the steps and you're good to go in no time. You could also download the Tether app available for Android and iOS devices for changing settings and monitoring the list of connected devices on the fly.\n\nGo for it, it's well worth your money.\n",0,,,,,,,,

When i do a speedtest i get 50Mbps download &amp; this is slightly fluctuating for around 2-3%. The 5g bandwidth provides blazing speeds but less range &amp; 2.5g bandwidth provides decent Range but less speeds. this gigabit router doesn't mind if you're wirelessly connected or over LAN the speeds are always damn good.\n\nThe Router Setup was fairly good (for non-technically ones, it'll be damn good experience) through the Application.\nalso the features are pretty impressive.\n\nThank you Amazon for delivering it in 48hrs as promised.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The wall penetration is adequate but not as good as 👉""Tenda A10"". Mine is a 100Mbps connection and following are the speed results;\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n5Ghz - Same room, 90Mbps+ up &amp; dwn. After a wall, (4-5m) no range!\n2.5Ghz- Same room, 30-45Mbps up &amp; dwn. After a wall or two, 15-25Mbps up &amp;dwn.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nThe rage of 2.4Ghz is good after 3 walls but the speeds are terrible. I am not recommending this. After many reviews and articles, I found that among Tenda A10, Archer C6 and Archer C60, the TP-Link Archer C60 is the best performer. But the problem with TP-Link Archer C60 that, it has no gigabit port.\n\nI got two of these C6 modem and both are terrible with video calls. Constantly disconnects each. Returned both of them and got Tenda AC10. Now everything works perfectly. Tenda AC10 also have the 2.4Ghz slow speed issue. Now I am planning to return it and go for TP-Link Archer C80 AC1900. 😔😔\n\nFor the 100Mbps connection, TP-Link Archer C60 is the best under rs. 2500.\nFor range, buy the Tenda A10. But speeds are same as Archer C6!!\n",1,,,,,,,,

The seller has placed multiple routers in a single ad. The Star ratings that you see is an aggregate of all the routers. Therefore, let me first clarify that this review is about the TP-WR902AC Travel Router. Seller has put so many routers on the same page either inadvertently - or deliberately. Either way, it misleads customers.\n\nWhen you start to set up the router, it asks whether you want to configure this as a ""3G/4G Router"" or as a ""Wireless Router"". One of my uploaded images clearly shows ""3G/4G USB"" written beside the USB port. If you are seeing Q&amp;A to understand this router, you will have seen some answers saying that there is no USB port. If you have been to the Q&amp;A section, I am sure you are as confused as I was.\n\nNot only does this router have a USB port - the port serves a dual purpose.\n* In 3G/4G mode, this is where you connect the dongle\n* In Wireless Router mode, this accepts an external USB which can be accessed by your devices with proper configuration. I have added a screenshot for this too - showing my external USB disk partitions as sda1 and sda2\n\nConfiguration is easy - my son (12th std) got to work on a router for the first time and he did it in minutes. Both 5 GHz and 2.4GHz WiFi working excellently (Yes - you will have two WiFi signals from this one, as the AC suffix suggests)\n\nIf you configure this as a repeater, you will experience loss of speed (as with ALL repeaters - something which I explained in my review of the Netgear EX3110 extender ... search for ASIN: ""B07B1B2CZT""). However, in my case I pulled a LAN cable from my main router to this one. This makes it simple to connect - just select ""dynamic IP"" and your router is connected. I get ISP speed and hence happy about it.\n\nJust beside the ethernet connector, there is a switch to select whether you want to share ethernet, share a hotspot or create an Access Point.\n\nSignals are very strong (as expected, the 2.4GHz gives higher range while 5GHz gives better Signal-Noise ratio). The 2.4 GHz is reaching a third room about 20 feet away - penetrating two walls. So yes - the signal is good.\n\nThree dampeners why I gave one star less:\n1. Cable is just about 1 foot long (see image). Now *that* is cost cutting. I had to use an extension board to be able to place it on the table. Plug point is just about a metre higher. Wonder how much profit TP Link is making by saving the cable length !!\n2. The MiniUSB charging port is a bit inside - therefore every miniUSB charging cable may not be suitable (it will keep falling off). To get a proper one, you need to see and compare the sizes to buy the longest (This one needs an additional 1mm to fit properly). This is not the only device with this issue - and there are many cables easily available - only you need to physically search for it. Online purchases may not work.\n3. This does *NOT* accept third party software. dd-wrt definitely is incompatilbe. OpenWRT includes this under their compatible routers list, but their forum says they lose the 5GHz band. Also - no clarity whether OpenWRT will support the 3G/4G mode. However, the OEM firmware is great in itself offer many options to use. So I suggest you stick to it.\n\nThe hardware version I got was TL-WR902AC v3 00000001 which probably uses a Mediatek card. The preloaded firmware was 0.9.1 0.2 v008a.0 Build 191209 Rel.57116n(5553). When I tried to upgrade from the India site, it said incompatible firmware and when I googled more to realize that this is probably a US firmware. I tried to upgrade to the US firmware and was told that the router already already the latest, so no changes made here.\n\nSUMMARY\nPros: Ethernet input, Dual-purpose USB, 3G/4G support and rock solid dual-band signals in a pocket-sized package costing less than ₹ 2000 ... I guess that speaks volumes to help you decide.\nCons: Short power cable (1 foot) and no compatibility with dd-wrt or OpenWRT made me reduce one star.\n\nI felt that this is truly what it claims to be - a powerful travel router with 3G/4G mode available.\n",1,,,,,,,,

I am not gonna into a detailed review, but I would like to highlight some points that were raised by some other reviewers.\n1. It is ver2 of the hardware, and yes, it's designed to be sold in the US. But it does not matter since this is not a modem, but a router. It works perfectly when plugged into the lan port of your existing router/modem.\n2. The range for 5GHz is not terrible. It is much lower than that of 2.4GHz but that is to be expected.\n3. Speed on 5GHz throughout my double storey house does not drop beyond 50 Mbps. So, I've disabled the 2.4 band.\n\nI have this router plugged into my ZTE Router/Modem that was provided to me by my ISP (Connect Broadband, Punjab). The modem has a GE port. Make sure that whatever you plug this into has a GE port. GE stands for Gigabit Ethernet. Without GE on your modem, this will be a waste of money for you.\n\nLast point, make sure that you're using at least a Cat5E cable for the connection. The one supplied in the box is also 5E, but if you can get 6 that would be perfect.\n\n5E can only supply speeds upto 100 Mbps in theory.\n\nHope you found this review helpful!\n",0,,,,,,,,

This router doesn't have a straightforward mentioning about using it as a wifi repeater or extender but it does have the WDS capability.\nIt took me 15 mins to figure out where the WDS enabling option was situated, after that I tried to set it up as a repeater or extender and it took me 3 hours and believe me I thought I was a techie. It could be tricky to setup but after a good amount of googling I found a blog on the tplink website that explains about setting up WDS. It took some time, but finally things were up and running.\nPerformance is great , I could run full HD videos on 3 devices parallely.

You really REALLY need a mesh or other router of the same company to connect more devices.\n\n2) Well if you go to the advance stuff, normal people will toggle the wrong settings, Really most of the things in advance mode is seriously configure, only use basic mode for less craziness.\n\n3) It's USB 2.0, so don't expect those serious transfer rate like USB 3.0 or Type-C provides. But it's is nice to have this feature.\n\n4) There is a TP-Link Cloud but it applies to home or office security and you have to pay for the cloud storage(If you have or someone has experience).\nWell lets buy a 2TB or 1TB hard drive and job done.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The internet speed over LAN and WIFI drop to less than a quarter of total speed and this is frequent. Changing the firmware to old version solves the issue for sometime but again the internet drops and constant followup with customer care makes you feel that buying this was a bad choice. Recently the whole tp link forum is flooded with internet speed deteriorating issues. I would strongly recommend a different brand. This is the 3rd time in 6 months, like how many times do you want to reset the device, change firmwares and keep contacting the customercare.\n",1,,,,,,,,

But was utterly disappointed at the quality of one of the packets delivered on this order. As per jacket, the packet was current, and delivered without any external damage, but on opening the first smaller roll-pack from inside, find that the biscuit has been moth eaten, as can be seen from image. Unfortunately, I put the first one without noticing, and the taste told me that something was wrong, when I put all the cookies on a plate to find the moth eaten bodies, which generated a nausea.\nUtterly disappointed, and doubt whether I'll buy the brand again over the counter even.\n",1,quality,1,taste,1,,,,

I had bought this one to use it upstairs. It can be described as just a Chinese one branded in their name. Such a flimsy structure. The motor of supposed 1200w delivers a quarter of its power only. This one is just 8 months old and is DEAD now. I have booked a service and as usual there is no response from anyone.\n\nYou can know the company's attitude from certain things.\n● They don't disclose their service center's location or phone. The only access is their customer-care which is a premium charged number. Whenever you call the customer-care, you get the so-called parroting message. They don't want anyone to contact them. Any other company, you can take the product to their service centre at your convenient time and pick it up back the same. Here, you have to wait for the technician any time any day for 1 or 2 months.\n● There are three stages of escalation. Believe me, the third stage is a ""Eureka Forbes Ombudsman"". But none of the web forms work. In this new age, they require the customers to download, print and fill-up the form and send it by ordinary post. See the attitude.\n● They always confuse you using the words direct channel, indirect, franchisee, agent, sub-agent, etc. One guy would come and sell you some product or AMC with proper invoice and another guy would tell you that it is not the correct route and would deny service.\n● They deleted my comment on their facebook page detailing my complaint. Just read the comments on their Facebook and Twitter pages, and you'll know.\n\nEureka Forbes had a point years back when it was a monopoly in the market. I know, in my childhood, the executive would give a demo as if it had rocket science inside. The picture is changed. There are quality products with much advanced features at quite low prices. Never go for any Eureka Forbes product. Never expect any service from them.\n",1,,,,,,,,

But the thing is the suction is not good at all. If you really want to buy a vacuum cleaner then go for higher suction as this is like car vacuum cleaner . Not at all recommended for domestic chores. I tried for a replacement to buy a better one but they said if the product is not damaged they won't take the return. It is disappointing. I wouldn't want refund , I only would have opted for a better machine. But seems I am stuck with this one. Have to buy a sturdy and heavy duty machine later but am not going to buy something anytime soon. So LOOK before you LEAP. I repeat do not get swayed by the reviews here or in YouTube. No to paid reviews or else you will end up wasting money on such fancy- looking-good - for- nothing's.\n",1,,,,,,,,

High Suction Power (1900W)\n 2. Metal Rod.\n 3. High quality Plastic.\n 4. Compact design\n\nCons:\n 1. Noisy above 1 ( that restricts the usage to certain hours of the day only to avoid disturbance to the neighbors in an Apartment )\n 2. Does not suck hair or minute dust that effectively. After vacuum, I could sense the dust while I walk, it wasn't the case with my previous vacuum cleaner. This is kind of disappointing as the power it has. I think, it is because of actual surface area of the vacuum roller base. We think that entire area where the roller travels will suck it, but only near the center portion of the roller base sucks the dust. Hence you need to move it multiple times in a particular area.\n3. Not very effective in cleaning spider webs. Have to be bit careful otherwise it black web sticks to the wall itself.\n\nStill managing with this as my return period is over. Now a days, Not very enthusiastic in vacuuming my house due to these limitations.\n",1,,,,,,,,

The suction power is very powerful (you have to be careful where you point it), the cord and pipe length is sufficient and quality is sturdy. What I didn't like was-\n\n1. Delivery- Outer box was in very bad shape, broken at many places. It just takes away the happiness out of the whole experience initially.\n\n2. The misleading product description - It has Hepa 10 filter and not Hepa 13 as mentioned here on its page. Hepa 13 is the best filter and they have mentioned that this vaccum cleaner has it, but what is clearly mentioned on the box and on the vaccum cleaner is the fact that it is only Hepa 10, not true hepa.\n\n3. Lack of attachments - The attachments provided are few and you most probably will have to buy some extras like I am planning to do. They have focussed on turbo brush which is second one for carpets, but in Indian settings one attachment for carpets is sufficient and some other useful ones like brushes for attaching to the extension pipe are required.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Its suction power reduced considerably over time and it stops working after 10 mins due to overheating.\n\nWe went for purchase to reliance digital and other shops but they seem to be biased towards our previous brand.

After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.\n\nPros:\n\n1) Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.\n2) Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks. For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.\n3) It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.\n4) Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription. You can stream in Amazon prime video, music from prime music, become an Amazon prime member, free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.\n5) You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips, Xiaomi, Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devices.\n\nCons:\n\n1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant, Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)\n2) It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered (same is the case with Google home)\nSo if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with, Google home is your choice. For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.\n",0,,,,,,,,

For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)\n\nEdit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Audio has been dramatically improved, too, both in terms of quality and loudness, which makes Alexa easier to understand and means that the odd bit of music or radio is a possibility.\n-If you're looking to put Alexa in more rooms, then this is the device to buy.\n\nPros\n-Clear and loud audio\n-3.5mm and Bluetooth audio outputs\n-Same price as old model\n-Improved design\n\nCons\n-No longer USB-powered\n-Not ideal for music\n",0,,,,,,,,

Plug your echo on and download alexa on your phone.\n\n2. From the alexa app, pair your phone with your echo device first to establish the first connection between your phone and your echo.\n\n3. We need to set up wifi access on echo so that alexa on echo can be alive. To do that, after you've paired your echo with your phone, proceed to where you can search for the available wifi networks. Connect to your wifi network on alexa app by entering your wifi password. Post this, your echo should be connected to wifi and alexa on your echo should be online.\n\n4. You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.\n\n5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.\n\nAs for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.\nThe bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.\nEcho plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.\nYou cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.\n\nI hope this helps. Peace'o &amp; cheerios folks :)\n",0,,,,,,,,

They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product. “ excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown.” I think amazon policy are worst. They stand in the last of the top companies list. They have no customer satisfaction. Even apple has extended there warranty of their product in lockdown.

Well... Well,\nSo I bought this product on Amazon Great Indian Festival sale. I know it s too late to buy 3rd gen while 4th gen is coming in short time. I was thinking about 4th gen but my budget didnt allowed me to buy that so I went for echo dot 3rd gen with Wipro smart bulb for ₹2299. I had another option too like dad said me to choose between Nike Mid by air shoes or Alexa!!\n\nThere isnt any other smart speaker better than Echo dot and Alexa... she s so amazing I loved her response time and also whisper to talk silently in the middle of night!!\n\nI was also thinking about Google Nest (home) mini but I saw many many positive reviews about echo dot and also watched hundreds of videos before buying this.\n\nPS- My mum was denying about alexa and she said what do to with useless speaker. I must say she s only who totally used alexa from it s arrival!!\n",0,,,,,,,,

One thing to ensure, is that you set the language to English, india. Mine was set as English, US. The device had difficulty picking up my accent as it is on the neutral side. There have been plenty of times where Alexa just does not understand me, or understands me wrong, and that was quite frustrating. I eventually switched the language as the other echo dot I had gifted to my parents used an Indian accent. Once done, it's been pretty smooth sailing and Alexa is quite helpful. I can update my calendar with voice control now. I can also control a LED bulb from syska which came as a bundled deal in one of the Amazon shopping festivals. The audio quality is fantastic, my only grouse is they should have probably included a rechargeable battery.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Sound quality is very good and crystal clear.\n\nBut as a smart speaker it need a lot of improvements. Sometimes it doesn't understand very simple questions and sentences. Sometimes it will not play the song you are telling it to play, it plays a song with similar name. Sometimes you will need to tell song's singer, and movie etc to play songs, which according to me ruins the experience.\n\nIt need a lot of AI improvements. If you are looking for a very smart speaker then go for Google Home mini or Google Home. It will not satisfy you as a AI but it has better sound quality then Google home mini and it connects with a lot of smart devices which google home mini can't. The choice is yours.\n\nGood Speaker :- Echo Dot\nGood AI :- Google Home mini\n",1,,,,,,,,

Alexa integration is great, it can do things like movie tickets booking, can book a cab, it can easily be linked to apple music or other streaming services, can read news and specially it can understand hindi which is awesome. Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device. These mics works just awesome, it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room, all you have to do is say “Alexa” and she activates. The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment, she can hear you. Echo dot can be easily linked to other devices.\nIt also works with almost all the smart home devices.( smart bulbs, hubs, microwave, etc)\n\n*Note: Echo dot requires a high-speed wifi connection (more than 20Mbps) for better experience. It also requires permanent power supply. If you need a portable echo dot you can go for the portable one which was launched in December 2019.\n",0,,,,,,,,

It has volume up/down, set-up button with a nifty mute button. It has an ever convenient aux port for connecting to audio system which itself is a reason for my purchase. It can also connect with Bluetooth.\nSet-up was easy with the Alexa app and there a plethora of skills to try out.\nSound was warm and the volume could be room filling. As expected there isn't enough bass but other than that the sound is good. Voice recognition is good and it may miss low voices. The Alexa voice is itself is like a person which is good and adds a personality to it. It can sometimes give very witty contextual answers. It's best used with Amazon products and generally good. Home automation is an area where it has an edge as most of the smart home products are Alexa compatible and generally speaking Alexa is best suited for Indian scene. I can stream high quality music from Amazon music being a prime member to my sound system and have added convenience of a smart speaker. You can find good deals and bundles at festivities if you are planning to purchase it.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).\n2.pretty loud for the sound .\n3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.\n4.robust design .\n5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .\n\nCons:\n1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.\n2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.\n3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .\n4. Heats up a bit on the top .\n5.wifi coverage isn't the best .\nWell If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.\nAlexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features\n",1,,,,,,,,

While the previous gen dot was more of an ""Echo Input"" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:\n1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music\n2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)\n3. Spotify not available ""yet""\n4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons\n5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.\n\nSummary:\nIf you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Its intuitive, speech recognition is superb we use it for hindi and english and sometimes ‘Hinglish’ also :-), a big thanks to the Amazon team. Even while its placed in Drawing room and we call Alexa from bedroom, it has all the ears to us and plays our favourite songs flawlessly. Overall a best fit and a must have. I guess, more than 10 guests who visited us have purchased it on their own after enjoying its performance. Must buy!\n",0,,,,,,,,

Can't predict 100% will, 1 or 2 percent will have some issues.\nIf you building up a new PC for gaming, you can use this 6K for some other parts (processor, ram, motherboard...).

Damn it! Indian government, stop it, get some help!\n\nIf you are an Indian, let's flood the Indian government's Twitter handle with #ReduceTaxOnGraphicsCards!\n\nBack to the review\n\nWorks pretty much well(I guess).\n\nWell make sure you have at least I5 6400 processor and 8gb of ram with it so it doesn't bottleneck.\n\nDon't use the driver's which came with it (but install msi afterburner and msi kombustor from the disk) because those drivers don't work. Just Google ""Nvidia Drivers"" and *manually* give your GPU name and stuff , and install the drivers.\n\nAnd some of you guys might be thinking to buy the 6gb version, right?\nWell, I would recommend you the 3GB one only cause the difference in the performance is just 10% - 5% (6gb also has more cuda cores) and that isn't much a difference. I would not spend 6000 Indian rupees ( approx $90) for just a 10% difference. (And for non Indian guys, well... Are you ready to spend $90 just for a difference of 10 to 5 percent?).\n\nWell if you are a performance freak, well... you can get the same performance as the big fat 6gb one just by overclocking the memory by approx 90 to 100 mhz and if that crashes your card, (and if you don't wanna increase the voltage) overclock the memory with 50mhz and the core clock with 50mhz.(it will give a slightly less performance)\n\nCheers!\n",1,,,,,,,,

Everything is bought here on Amazon within days of each other and it is perfectly matched.\n\nI recommend this processor and whole setup to anyone interested in building a top-of-the-line gaming computer that will not be outdated anytime soon.\n\nHighly recommended.\n,0,,,,,,,,

Been using them with my Ryzen 5 2400g and Gigabyte B450M-DS3H motherboard with no problems at all.\n\nThe RAM sticks come with a 3000MHz XMP profile out of the box, which means that they are verified stable at that frequency from the factory. Some have also been able to achieve 3200MHz on these Teams, but I haven't tried it a yet.\n\nThese RAMs should be supported on all motherboard that use DDR4 standard and support XMP profiles. After installing them, if you do not see them running at 3000MHz, go to you motherboard's BIOS/UEFI and enable XMP(Xtreme memory profile).\n\nOne last note for those who want to use it for Ryzen, please buy 2 sticks to run in Dual Channel. I bought two 8gb sticks for a total of 16gb dual channel, and gaming performance on my Ryzen 5 is impressive.\n\nAs for the price, I bought them a month ago for Rs3100 per piece, but as of writing this review, prices are Rs4790 per piece. For me, it was a steal when I purchased them.\n\nOverall, a great product for budget PC builds if available at a reasonable price.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Excellent performance RAM.,"\n On reading several feedbacks from the buyers I bought the product. So far working perfectly with my existing RAM stick with same spec. Didn't go for an overclocking since it is little risky. If you want to get the full speed, you will have to set the xmp profile to 3000 Mhz in the BIOS if your MOBO supports that. Sometimes you will have to opt for a BIOS update to get the feature. The supplied product seems genuine. Good choice for gamers. Definitely you can go for that.

USB Type B is an older port and is replaced by mini usb 5 pin B which this mic would now come with. Mine was usb mini as mentioned and I was successfully able to register my product serial number with Logitech (Since Blue company is now acquired by Logitech). Even Blue Sherpa Companion app was able to find my mic with correct serial number. So relax it is original only.\nNow for the review part-\n1. Amazon packaging was pathetic the box was damaged, they sent me the box in a white amazon polythene instead of packing it inside a cardboard box. Not sure what happened here usually Amazon pack things nicely so I guess it was the seller (Bought it from prime seller). However luckily my mic was not damaged. (Touchwood)\n2. Talking about mic itself, it is simply amazing, It captures the lows, the mids and the highs perfectly without any problems.\n3. Noise cancellation is okay, not best for sure but very decent, live streaming should not be a problem at all and if you are using it for voice overs you can post process it in either audacity or premier pro to make it sound like a professional studio mic.\n4. The wire sent with the mic was black for some reason even though my mic was white but it still looks absolutely stunning sitting on your desk, clubs very well with the setup, definitely an eye catcher.\n5. Stand provided with it is sturdy and has nice rubber feet so it will not slip off easily and will hold it’s position.\n Overall a great mic even in 2020 for beginners and growing youtubers, definitely gives you a professional edge without putting a whole in your pocket. I bought it during covid so costed me around 5k but you should be able to find a good deal on this, though it’s still worth it at 5k considering the sound it’s amazing sound quality. Would have given 5 stars but had to cut 1 star for packaging.\n\nIf you’re looking for a condenser mic which is easy to setup and is bang for your buck, look no further and buy this. You will not regret.\n\nThanks for taking time out to read my review. Stay safe, be healthy and take care.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Hats off to Amazon! Packaging was great as usual from Amazon/Cloudtail.\n\nI have posted a comprehensive unboxing/review video on my YouTube channel. Please check that out for the mic test at this link -\n[...]\n\nI wanted an entry level/budget microphone for my YouTube videos. After going through reviews of the Blue Snowball, Samson Meteorite and Blue Snowball ICE, I decided to get this one. In the package you'll get the microphone, USB cable, tripod stand and a manual. The build quality is excellent and feels very premium. The microphone itself looks very cute and stylish. It feels very solid and sturdy in the hand.\n\nSetup is very simple. You just need to screw the tripod stand into the microphone and set it on the table. Plug the microphone into the laptop via the USB cable and the light on top of the microphone glows red. That's it! Its good to go! Its plug and play, so no drivers or software or application required. Go to Sound settings of your laptop and select the Snowball ICE as the recording device. You can then use any audio recording software (like Audacity) to record the audio. It takes power from the laptop and no separate power source required.\n\nThe Snowball ICE only has a cardioid/uni-directional mode for recording. So it'll pick up sound from any source directly in-front of it. The optimal distance between the sound source and the microphone should be around 8-12 inches. Moving farther away from the mic will reduce the intensity and up close you would hear your voice popping at the 'B's and 'P's.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget USB microphone for podcasts/YouTube videos/Skype calls, then look no further. I got it for Rs. 4399 as part of the festive season sale. Excellent microphone and I am very happy with it!\n",0,,,,,,,,

I think the issue might be that the Snowball is the first condenser mic a lot of people have any experience with. They can put out amazing quality, but they need to be in an environment that takes into account that they pick up damn near everything. Unless you have a pop filter, a relatively quiet room, position it appropriately, run it through a mixer or make up for it by doing a good bit of processing afterwards, the quality can seem not up to par to a similarly priced dynamic. Condensers are really sensitive by nature. If you have a fan going, some crazy PC with 120MM fans blasting away, near a window where you get occassional traffic, in an open room with empty uncovered walls, then a Snowball is just going to sound like nonsense before post. If you actually have a recording area that's quiet, doesn't have a ton of wind moving through it, has some manner of sound proofing and is positioned and configured properly, then it can really shine.\n",0,,,,,,,,

But I am slightly disappointed.\nPreviously I had bought a 480 gb ssd from Kingston, and installed on a laptop with i5 processor, 8gb ram. Performance was hugely improved. Apps launched much quicker, it felt like a completely different laptop.\n\nSo this time I tried to install this ssd in my old amd a6 laptop with 4gb ram, but performance improvement was not much.

And there after sales support, tools to migrate/clone c drive is easy to use. But it is always better to do a fresh windows install than cloning/migrating.\n\nThis is a QLC ssd, which is in theory the slowest ssd type. But what crucial has done here is added SLC caching so it behaves like SLC ssd for small files (10-20% of total capacity). If you are looking for boot drive, drive that has games installed and you generally want a storage ssd this is one to buy. If you are a photographer, video editor or a person who has to copy/paste/work with large amount of files every day then go for a SLC/MLC ssd (these are very costly). For general use you can buy a QLC or TLC SSD, they are cheap as compared to SLC/MLC ssd\n",0,,,,,,,,

It take 30-40 minutes to take windows to boot. And the application installations process is very slow because windows 10 is running in my HDD, and it is very slow. It takes lot of time. So for upgrading I need more money like I need to change my entire system like motherboard, processor so it will definitely cost me upto 15-20k for a budget gaming pc motherboard and processor like amd ryzen 3 or intel core i3. So I choose this SSD which save my system. Now it takes only 8 second for windows 10 booting and the application installations is very fast. It is very quick response. It is recommended to connect to SATA port with 6gb per second speed mine is 3gb per second, in my port I need only 8 second to boot so in 6gb per second port it is will definitely work in lighting speed than my 3gb per second port. I recommend this product. It is very helpful in gaming. It will load the game very fast than HDD. GTA V is loading very much fast in my pc\n",0,,,,,,,,

Got it for 5.3k Indian rupees, and couldn't be happier.\n\nNote: If you're installing your old HDD in an external enclosure, use a USB 3.0 one because if you use a USB 2.0 enclosure, you'll get read speeds of 60 MB/s instead of 100 MB/s which could hinder with things like games.

I install the Crucial Storage Executive to monitor the drive as well as 1. activate momentum cache (the software it comes packaged with recommends you activate in modern PCs to avail its full power) 2. over-provision (I didn't understand this so didn't switch it ON as the laptop performed like butter as it was).\nAfter using for over 15 days, I would say that leave at least half of the drive you've installed Windows/any OS on empty as your SSD uses that space to speed up your machine. Also, update firmware and all drivers for your system to not bottleneck.\nIf you're thinking about gaming, this is not the solution you want. SSDs are a storage solution, not graphics processing. Although, if you have a GPU built-in, you will see very noticeable change in games (or for that matter, any software) installation and loading.\nFile copying is fast enough, not even close to the advertised 500MB/sec, but it goes up to 250 MB for large files sometimes, which is sufficient because you won't even probably see the copy bar.\nBooting time reasonably fast, with very little time required by background processes to start to leave my PC for me to actually start working on.\n",0,,,,,,,,

I got this SSD for rupees 2499 which I think is worth the money. If you want to buy an SSD for cheap then go for it because BX 500 comes with 3D technology with boost up the SSD performance and hence it is faster than another simple SSD but not much faster than high and SSD such as Samsung 860 EVO or 860 Pro but the difference is not much.

Is it compatible with old system like decade old or having SATA 2.0 or SATA 1.0 ?\nAns. Yes it's compatible but speed will be reduced to SATA 2.0 or SATA 1.0.\n\nSome old system requires BIOS update to fully recognised the SSD , so keep your BIOS up to date(If BIOS update is available).\n\n2. Which attributes in SMART(Self monitoring , analysis reporting technology ) to be checked for SSD health?\nAns. Download Crystal disk info to check smart attributes.\nIn smart attribute, check for wear leveling count it is directly related to the health of the SSD, as you write on SSD ,wear leveling count decreases.\nSome may notice that just after some 200 GB write wear leveling decreases to 99 from 100 but in reality it only decrease by 0.1 ,that is from 100 to 99.9.\n\n3. Impact on SSD on sudden shut down i.e., power cutoff ?\nAns. Now a days SSD can resist power cutoff but its highly recommended to not do sudden shut down as repeatedly doing may cause SSD to fail.\nIn SMART attribute check for POR(Power On Recovery) count ,it will tell how many times SSD goes shutdown unexpectedly. For every one sudden power off POR count increases by 1.\n\n4. What to check just after upgrading to SSD ?\nAns. Check Power on count , power on hours, both must be at zero initially.\nAll the attributes should be at 100 in crystal disk info. If not then it is used one and should be replaced.\n\n5. Warranty issue on Samsung ?\nAns. Upon registration on Samsung website it is showing out of warranty , don't worry it will honor the warranty according to the invoice provided.\n\n6. Warning : Never defrag the SSD as it will rewrite the same data on the same section of the SSD which can cause poor wear leveling and repeatedly defragmentation may cause SSD to fail.\nOS like Windows 7 or XP do defrag the SSD so keep them disabled permanently.\n\n7. For Mac users whose SSD becomes very slow or gets failed after 1 or 1.5 years it is because in mac the trim function is disabled by default for non OEM SSD (SSD not pre-installed by Apple) so just after installing the OS in mac do enable the trim function.\n\n8. It is recommended to fresh install the OS in SSD instead of migrating OS from HDD to SSD as some settings is optimised for HDD which may cause trouble from SSD or SSD may not work to its maximum potential.\n\n9. Before installing the OS in SSD do change the SATA protocol from ATA or IDE to AHCI in BIOS as AHCI is optimised for SSD.\n\n10. Do know about DRAM and DRAMLESS SSD and choose the SSD wisely , DRAM SSD is costly but having much faster RANDOM read and write than Dramless SSD.\n\n11. Don't tweak the OS default settings just for sake of SSD health like virtual memory or fast startup as it may cause your system unstable, don't worry about TBW value as it requires many years even to reach 50 percent of total TBW.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Now my windows is super fast. Boot in seconds, system ready in seconds. Now I love it more than macbook air.\n\nAbout Cloning your OS from HDD to new SSD - Use 'Macrium Reflect' for cloning. Works like charm. No issues at all.\n\nNow windows boots &amp; ready to work just within 20 seconds. I repeat, within 20 seconds and you can start working.\n\nIn short, this 6k ssd saved my 60k investment in windows laptop.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Even top-class hardware will crawl if any of component is low grade which in my case its 5400rpm HDD. So i ordered SSD in the first place.\n\nSince, I earlier had 2.5"" SATA SSD in my XPS laptop, which was an upgrade to 7200 RPM SATA HDD, it was impossible for me to continue with HDD only config in this new Inspiron as it was laggy everywhere with huge boot time, app open time, slow interface, etc. It's like, once you get used to SSD, you just can't accept HDD in any case. :D\n\nGot it from Amazon @3599 during prime days. Normally it's available for 5k approx with MRP of 7999. A few years ago got the same SSD (EVO 850) in 2.5"" form factor for double the price ~8.5k. Technology &amp; price have interesting relationships. :D\n\n•••••••••\nINBOX\n•••••••••\n\n1. Solid State Drive\n2. Warranty &amp; Installation Guide\n3. Samsung Magician Software Leaflet\n\n••••••••\nPROS\n••••••••\n\n1. Highly reliable SSD by Samsung.\n2. As expected, the performance boost is great.\n3. Drive has great read/write speeds as per industrial standards.\n3. 512MB DRAM cache for performance improvement. Many SSD manufacturers skip this cache.\n4. It comes with 5 years warranty or 150 TBW.\n\n••••••••\nCONS\n••••••••\n\n1. Doesn't come with mounting screw. But that's the case with all. Many laptops will already have it in place.\n2. No heatsink provided. But again, the same is the case with all.\n\n▶ Samsung is a pioneer in this department of SSD and its EVO series is distinguishable by its name only, but still, they can provide certain addon things mentioned above to further kill the competition.\n\n▶ These cons affect initial setup and long term performance. 1 star deducted for that. So a ★★★★ star device.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••\nINSTALLATION\n••••••••••••••••••••\n\n→ I went on opening up all-new Inspiron 5580 to reveal the internals (following official guide by Dell available at support page) &amp; install Samsung 860 EVO M2 SSD. But a surprise was waiting inside to spoil my plans.\n\n→ There was no SSD screw mount &amp; screw inside. I contacted Dell customer care, hardware support, authorized seller/service center, local hardware shops, etc &amp; spent hours over the phone but without any luck. So had to settle with the double-sided tape, which in fact is quite risky. But so far its working good. I'll have some better custom screw mount arrangement in near future to secure SSD.\n\n→ In general, most of the laptops won't require any mount for SSD. Only a screw will suffice to secure it in place.\n\n→ As expected, there's huge performance improvement everywhere, super-fast boot time, snappy interface, faster apps, games, etc. In short beast mode is now active.\n\nNOTE\n\n▶ Installation instructions vary from model to model &amp; manufacturer to manufacturer. So, it can't be detailed here. To know about that, just head to the support page of your laptop manufacturer to find an official guide or perform a general search for disassembly instructions of your model. You will definitely find some text or video guide to do it.\n\n▶ Remember to use SSD as a primary OS drive, else your investment will be useless if you boot using HDD only and use it as a parallel storage drive only.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nOS &amp; SOFTWARE SETUP\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nOnce you install SSD you have two options to either clone HDD to SSD or to fresh install OS. I personally prefer a fresh install as it refreshes everything.\n\nAs a general practice, you should format &amp; reinstall OS once every year to refresh it &amp; to remove junk built up over time. You can always feel the difference after a fresh install. Also if you have recently upgraded your OS, a format or reset is recommended to avoid a variety of incompatibility issues that may arise.\n\n1. Cloning can be done using any related software like Minitool Partition Wizard, EaseUS, Samsung Data Migration, etc. For this, you need to install SSD first and then clone the existing OS into SSD using the tool. After that, you need to make it the first boot device using Bios. You can easily find detailed guides for this task.\n\n2. Fresh install is very simple. Just install the drive in the slot, use USB drive or DVD to install OS into the SSD and change boot options to make SSD as a first boot device. Before fresh install, you have the option to change the mode to AHCI or RAID via BIOS. Choose as per your needs. Changing it later on breaks the already installed OS and you won't be able to boot into it.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nSCORES: HDD vs SSD\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\n→ 3D Mark 11: 3487 vs 3668\n→ PCMark 10: 2638 vs 3197\n→ PCMark 8: 3507 vs 3635\n→ Cinebench R20: 1151 vs 1175\n→ Read Speed: 134 MB/s vs 552 MB/s\n→ Write Speed: 123 MB/s vs 530 MB/s\n→ Boot Time (post-OS selection screen to windows desktop): 40 s vs 4 s\n→ Shutdown Time: 45 s vs 10 s\n\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nSAMSUNG EVO 860 SATA vs WD GREEN SATA vs NVMe SSD\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nThere is this WD green available for half the price of Samsung SSD, but if it's cheaper, there's a reason for that. Remember a thumb rule, ""you get what you pay for"".\n\nSamsung SSD comes with 5 yrs warranty while WD comes with 3 years warranty. These drives have limited life span wrt terabytes written, but Samsung is confident enough wrt their quality to provide you a 5 yrs warranty. There're other hardware differences b/w both wrt built-in DRAM cache 512MB vs none, power consumption (2.2 W vs 2.8 W), controller, latency, technology, etc.\n\nIn all there's WD Green (SATA) for budget-oriented people, then Samsung EVO 860 (SATA) in medium-range to balance price-performance ratio, &amp; for extreme performance seekers there's Samsung EVO Series (NVMe). HDD to SSD (SATA) &amp; then to SSD (NVMe), performance &amp; price both increase.\n\nRead speed ratio is like- HDD : SSD (SATA) : SSD (NVMe) - 100:500:2000 MB/s.\nSo an obvious performance difference.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nSAMSUNG MAGICIAN\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nSamsung Magician is an interesting software that you can get officially. If performs a variety of tasks like auto firmware update, run performance benchmarks, run performance optimization, securely erase the disk, manage overprovisioning, manage rapid mode, etc.\n\nYou can always install it to avail above features and check the status of SSD in terms of condition, bytes written, etc.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nWARRANTY &amp; TBW THING\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nTBW or Terra Bytes Written is a term used by SSD manufacturers to assess how much data can be written to the SSD before it is likely to fail.\n\nEVO 860 comes with 150 TBW or 5 years warranty, whichever occurs earlier. You can monitor TBW in Magician software. Don't worry, 150 Terra Bytes is too much to be written to a hard disk and an average user is unlikely to shoot up this limit in 5 years or even 10 years.\n\nSo far, mine has 1.5 TBW in a matter of a month with medium usage (daily run time of 12-15 hours with browsing, blogging, video editing, gaming, etc). So it will have only 90 TBW by the end of 5 years at the current usage rate.\n\nYou can reduce TBW with few tweaks and restricting SSD to only critical things eg installing non-critical software to HDD, moving hibernation file to HDD in case if you use hibernation a lot, etc. Paging file also contributes a lot to TBW but it's not recommended to move it to HDD as it will hamper performance a lot.\n\n•••••••••••\nVERDICT\n•••••••••••\n\n▶ Samsung EVO ss a nice buy in this price range, balancing price to quality &amp; performance ratio. If you want the best of both worlds, then this is the thing you should get. (Read/Write speeds approx 550/530 MB/s)\n\n▶ If on a tight budget, but want to have SSD goodness, go get WD Green for half the price of Samsung EVO 860 SATA SSD. You will still have huge performance differences visible across the OS if coming from regular HDD. (Read/Write speeds approx 100/80 MB/s to 500/450 MB/s)\n\n▶ If you can extend your budget further &amp; your laptop supports NVMe standard on M2 slot, get NVMe SSD instead of SATA, say Samsung 960 EVO. (Read/Write speeds approx 3200/1900 MB/s)\n\n▶ If budget is not a concern to you and you just want the best of it, without any doubt get Samsung 960 Pro. (Read/Write speeds approx 3500/2100 MB/s)\n\nOverall, getting SSD is recommended for obvious reasons. If not NVMe SSD, at least get a SATA SSD (be it WD Green or Samsung EVO, as per your budget) and unleash the hidden beast inside your rig.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Currently I am using Kingston and Samsung SSDs in my other laptops and desktops.\nI can recommend this Samsung SSD based on my experience for sure, regarding warranty Samsung has said that there is some issue at the website, because as soon as you register your SSD on their website it show 'out of warranty'. So as per Samsung warranty can be availed using the invoice, your SSD is covered with warranty as mentioned on Samsung website against the SSD model. If you don't have invoice then warranty will be given from the date of manufacturing.\nIf don't have high budget then you can go with affordable option like Kingston, as I am using them as well from long time. You won't feel any difference in day to day use, only difference you can see between high capacity SSDs (like 1TB or 2TB) and smaller size SSDs (like 120GB or 240GB), when you will be copying large files (i.e.,100GB). Higher capacity SSDs tend to have larger RAM (chache), due to which they can hold high speed copying (500MB/Sec or higher) for longer than smaller SSDs, because smaller SSD will have small amount of RAM (chache). With Samsung you can expect longer SSD life than other brand. Hope this would help someone to decide his/her SSD purchase decision.\n",0,,,,,,,,

For the ones with the adapter buy a product of which the model number ends with RW.\n\nWorks like a charm, read and write speeds are consistently around the 450-500 Mbps bracket.\n\nI cloned my existing OS to this one and it works like a charm.\n\nNow let's talk about performance, I used this to upgrade my Hp OMEN which has a i5 on board and since the upgrade the good old machine is giving a run for their money. And builds a strong case for people with an existing i5 machine to upgrade to an SSD. Now I haven't thrown away the old HDD, I just bought an enclosure to convert it to an external backup HDD which ensures the previous hardware doesn't become redundant.\n\nNow being a casual developer I have the complete Netbeans IDE, WAMp and Xampp servers installed along with Photoshop and Corel, add to that I keep on using Dockers, Containers and Kubernetesa few games like Sniper, NFS payback, the combination of the above are going to even kill the latest of the machines with an i7 under it's hood if you don't have an SSD. Now with the SSD on board this machine handles the stuff almost as good as a i7 laptop that I use for similar purposes. However gaming would still be a huge challenge as it depends primarily on the graphics card which renders great performance.\n\nThis investment has to be one of the best I haveade ever and people who still aren't willing to give up on their old buddy (machine's) with an investment as little as 10k you can significantly upgrade the specs and the performance.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Problems recurred after a week.\n\nMy diagnosis: Ageing disk, probably with few bad sectors that Apple formatting APFS was tripping over. Decided to change internal HDD to SSD, and add more RAM.\n\nSamsung 860EVO 500GB seemed the best, affordable choice. Would have preferred the ‘blade’ NVMe 970 Pro, but it is more than double the price; more importantly, it’s incompatible with the iMac’s pin and channel configuration.\n\nSo, I picked the Samsung 860 EVO and&nbsp;\n; \n &nbsp;for my upgrade.\n\nUpgrading the internal drive of a slim-profile (5mm) iMac is not easy. Even in experienced hands, there is a very high risk of damaging the LED display panel, which has to be sliced off the aluminium chassis (see iFixit’s tutorial). Even more dangerous is remounting the display panel, as the quality and strength of the tapes sold online are highly suspect, with many users reporting that their displays fell off and smashed after remounting with such tapes.\n\nThe OEM adhesive strip used by Apple is a custom 3M VHB tape (5mm wide, 1 mm thick). So I spoke with 3M India, and after keeping me dangling in hope for 3 weeks, they stopped taking my calls. Thanks 3M. :(\n\nThe workaround was to shop around with Apple Authorised Resellers / Service. None of them would sell me the mounting tape separately, but they would do my disk upgrade for a price ranging from ₹4800 to ₹2500 (tape + service). Seemed the better option, as it mitigated the risk of damaging the display panel and ruining my Mac.\n\nPreparation:\n• Installed the Crucial RAM myself (8GB x 2 slots).\n• Cloned my existing hard drive to the Samsung SSD 860 EVO, and ran it externally as the boot drive to check things out, for about a week.\n• Took my Mac and new, data-loaded and bootable SSD to an Apple Authorised Service Center, on the appointed date.\n\n2 hours later, my upgrade was done.\n\nI did not buy or use a 3.5 to 2.5” drive adapter; double-sided tape is sufficient to mount the SSD inside the iMac’s chassis (technicians concurred). Neither does the SSD require an external ‘thermal sensor’; it runs cool.\n\nPost upgrade:\n1. The first thing to do after the SSD is the internal boot drive is to startup normally, and do a full Time Machine backup.\n2. Once done, ENABLE TRIM (by default, Apple disables TRIM on 3rd party SSDs).\n3. Open Terminal, and type in (exactly, without the quote marks): “sudo trimforce enable”, then Y when asked ‘Do you want to proceed?’\n4. Reboot and press SHIFT (for SAFE BOOT)\n5. After boot, go to  &gt; About this Mac &gt; System Report &gt; SATA / SATA Express and see that TRIM is enabled\n6. Reboot normally, and you’re done!\n\n* Note 1: It is ALWAYS a good idea to keep at least 25% of your drive free for better system performance, so move those large files to an always-connected external device.\n* Note 2: Samsung Magician does not have a Mac version\n\nPost the upgrade from OEM Seagate 7200 rpm 1TB to Samsung 860 EVO SSD 500GB, drive speed is up almost 300%. All the spinning beachballs, unexpected shutdowns, and interminable startup times are gone. Things work at a snap (almost zero latency).\n\nSo far, I’m delighted!\n",0,,,,,,,,

The seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd. Thank you guys! The price paid for 500 GB Samsung EVO SSD is Rs. 6999.\n\nOh!, and for the records this SSD s MADE IN CHINA.\n\nPreparations.\n***********\nTook stock of my current OS was genuine Windows 10 running that was upgraded from OEM installed Windows 8.1. Data was already backed up in an external HDD. My Microsoft account was already linked to Windows 10 product key.\nMy first attempt to Migrate Windows 10 to SSD alone using USB recovery disk failed. Though the BIOS recognized the SSD, somehow the OS recovery using USB recovery disk was never completed at the end. Tried almost all configurations I just did not wanted wait to buy a caddy tray and experiment for lack of time. So, the second method of fresh OS install seemed to be the workable option.\n(Later on, I found out by web searches why the recovery process did not work. The EVO SSD was already partitioned! That means the existing partitions should be removed to install Windows 10 properly).\n\nMethod that worked.\n***********************\n1. Removed the HDD and installed SSD in that place.\n2. Changed BIOS setting to boot from USB. SSD was already detected and shown in BIOS.\n3. Downloaded Media creation tool from Microsoft and created USB bootable disk (Need 16 GB minimum. I used a 32 GB Sandisk USB drive for safety)\n4. Boot from the newly created bootable Windows 10 - version 2020. remove all exiting partitions and used complete disk for OS. No manual partitioning.\n5. After various reboots competed, connected to internet. Let the OS installation complete.\n6. Log on to the freshly installed Windows 10 using my Microsoft account (To which the Windows 10 CD Key is linked)\n\nVoila! My revitalized, super-fast 'fresh' Laptop is ready with all the required bells and whistles!\n\nNotes.\n*******\n1. Samsung recommends 10% of your disk space should be allocated to overprovisioning.\n2. If you have enable RAPID mode ( Kind of using RAM for disk write operations , in order to speed up things, you will have to allocate around 1.5 GB of memory to this operations. Go for this only if you are a minimum of 8 GB memory. I have not used RAPID mode because I don't need to write anything huge to the disks.\n\nVerdict.\n********\nConsidering all other alternatives, I found it is better to upgrade the HDD to SSD and add more RAM to my 5 years old laptop is the best way of utilizing resources during this Covid 19 time. Upgrading to Samsung EVO SATA SSD perfectly helped me to achieve that goal. My laptop is pretty fast to boot and does not heats up like before. That, by itself a great improvement.\n",0,,,,,,,,

They show it as 5-year limited warranty on Amazon too. I have not bothered much because the SSD was working fine.\n\nPros:\n1) Awesome Performance\n2) Booting is very Fast (My Laptop Config is i7, 16GB)\n3) Read &amp; Write Speeds are Great (See Pic)\n4) Apps open very fast\n5) Samsung Magician Software is very much useful for tuning the Drivers.\n6) Samsung Data Migration Software / Tool is very fast to take backup/cloning of Complete OS &amp; also the Installed Apps. So, after swapping the SSD your PC / Laptop all your apps &amp; OS will be in the same state but they run much faster.\n\nCons:\n1) First and ForeMost once you receive the SSD check the warranty status with the Serial Number (Samsung Site or Samsung Magician Software) &amp; then only proceed to install OS or other apps.\n2) I have not used the SSD for a year then I had some issues with SSD detection after some time after some hard work it worked. I was worried that it's gone.\n3) After the above Con's I would suggest going with a WD or Kingston SSD's which are much more reliable &amp; reasonably priced ( I don't see a reason why Samsung has charged a premium for this product except for Brand Image).\n\nHope, my experience and suggestions would Help someone.\n",1,,,,,,,,

Also, most laptop/desktop motherboards easily support varying lengths of m.2 SSDs like 2242 2260 and the longest 2280 (22 is the width in mm where as the last 2 numbers i.e. 42, 60 and 80 are the lengths in mm).\n\nAlso, a 2.5 inch (7 mm or 9 mm) HDD/SSD enclosure can also be bought so that you can keep your old HDD/SSD as a portable HDD/SSD within the enclosure. I bought the transparent ORICO 2.5 mm model 2193U3 HDD/SSD enclosure (have reviewed that as well) and i keep my 7200 rpm 1TB HDD inside this enclosure after having it replaced with the 2TB Samsung 870 EVO.\n\nLikewise, there is also an enclosure for the m.2 NVME PCIE SSD available from the same brand, ORICO. Check it out at amazon.in as well.\n\nSo, I made a BOOTABLE win10 usb (using the Windows Medial tool online) so that I can install the OS on the newly installed m.2 2280 ssd and the entire process took less than 30 mins from hardware installation to OS inatallation from USB to the new m.2 ssd.\n\nThere is Less to No Comparison of Quality and Price of Samsung SSDs with other brands like Sabrent, Crucial, WD etc.\n\nKindly like the review if it helped to make your buying decision that much easier.\n\nCheers and e-peace...\n",0,,,,,,,,

Over a period of time, I had found it to become slower.\nEven formatting and reloading doesn't help for too long. A friend of my suggested to replace the HDD with SDD and I'm glad I did. My previous HDD was 1TB however, windows itself doesn't take much size, so I decided to go for a 500GB instead. I gave this product 5/5 because of the below reasons:\n\n1. Cost - I paid Rs. 5200 &amp; got a cashback of Rs. 530, which effectively brought down the cost to Rs. 4670\n This was cheaper than the other brand, so I decided to go for it. For me, its worth it.\n2. Light weight - compared to the older HDD\n3. Easy to fix after searching for videos online.\n4. Amazing speed - The boot time is greatly reduced, programs load much faster.\n\nDo download Samsung Magician software provided by the maker and use it.\nVideos explaining features are also available online.\nI've enabled RAPID mode as well as Over Provisioning of 10% and enabled Trim.\n\nWhether you want to make your old laptop faster or simply make the new one even more faster, go for it.\nIt also reduces the risk of hard disk failure as no moving parts, data transfer is really fast between USB drives and it comes with a 5 year limited warranty.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Samsung magician software detected the HDD and performance benchmarks says 559 Read / 529 write speeds.\nThe only issue I faced was with the Warranty. After registering the product, the site mentioned that the SSD was out of warranty. But after contacting Samsung support, they said that the site was under maintenance and the warranty would be based on Invoice date. Settled with that as of now.\nOverall a perfect buy though the price is a bit on the higher side,\n",0,,,,,,,,

(I am still unware what my pack number and certificate number is and samsung CC is not helpful either in this regards)\n\nAdvice:\n1. If you are cloning OS, better optimize your existing disk first, use disk clean up and remove all the junk files etc. Remove all the unwanted S/Ws as well. In my case I cloned 200GB of my boot disk (WIN10 Home) and no issues regarding booting or performance were faced. It was just like plug and play.\n2. Download and use Samsung Data transfer software to clone, its very simple and easy.\n3. Download Samsung Magician software and upgrade the firmware (if it tells you to upgrade) and optimize the SSD using Magician, you will see even further improvements in disk performance.\n",0,,,,,,,,

And when I start any program or software then it took 10 min minimum to actual able to run. I see the the other components is very powerful but my hdd is very slow which is 5400 rpm. Then I think should I purchase new ssd m.2, hey guys first of all check the place where ssd m.2 is able to installed or not in your laptop. But notmally if you bought new laptop of current generation then off course 90% chance have it. But prior buy any type of ssd make sure to check ✔ whether it have m.2 or SATA port where your ssd fit into it.\nNow comming at my situation my notebook have m.2 port which is support new ssd of m.2 is look like RAM.\nThen I bought it and Fresh install new windows 10 Licensed. It is also very easy to fit in m.2 compartment. And you can fresh install windows into it. I would say to install Fresh windows because with fresh windows you are enjoy full performance of ssd. And if you want to migrant or clone from hdd then it only provide 70 to 80 % speed. So I should provide you to install fresh Windows 10 or whatever you want to install into new SSd.\nThen we come final result of my experience is\nNow when I start my notebook it take only 10 sec. To run any kind of program. And I also enjoy the performance of any kind of game like gta v and tome ride games.\nIf you have same kind of problems of lag issue then you also think about this ssd.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Massive above 500 MBps speed.,"\n This SSD is awesome. My windows now boot up in 5-10 seconds which is marvelous. Windows 10 certainly not made to work with HDD. I am using Asus X507-UF and it has an M.2 slot. This laptop beats even those high-end laptops that are way more expensive around 80K. I was very disappointed with the 100% disk usage issue. I use graphic design software like PhotoShop, Illustrator, and Indesign. Now with this SSD PhotoShop loads in just 2-3 seconds. Earlier it used to hand my laptop for a while.\n\nBasically, you need to install this SSD and use Macrium Reflect, which is a free tool to clone your old HDD data to SSD. It will take around 4-5 hours to complete back up. Once you are done, enter the boot menu and choose SSD. Then remove data from the old HDD and enjoy super fast computing. It saves a lot of time when you consider to do something productive.\n\nI was a bit skeptical between WD Blue and Samsung 860 Evo but later I decided to go with Samsung. We have 5 years of warranty with Samsung, but WD Blue is also almost same with a price gap of 800 INR. So, better to go with Samsung brand.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Features and specifications:\nToday I am looking at the new 860 EVO to see how Samsung has improved on the world's best selling SSD. Samsung's EVO series is so popular in some countries that it outsells every other SSD by a two to one margin. Samsung wants to leverage that proven formula with the new EVO series so it can cling to its dominant and profitable leadership position. Samsung changes its pricing when competitors close in, and the company always releases a faster model when others get too close to matching its performance.\nSamsung 860 EVO (250GB)\nCapacity (Raw / User)\n256GB / 250GB\nForm Factor\n2.5"" / M.2 2280 S3 / mSATA\nInterface / Protocol\nSATA / AHCI\nController\nSamsung MJX\n\n2. Features\nSamsung outfitted the 860 series with a new MJX controller that supports low-power DDR4 memory, so it likely has a new integrated memory controller. We also suspect the company built the MJX controller on a smaller lithography that enables lower power consumption, cooler operation, and reduced manufacturing costs.\nIf you have been an engineer either computer or electrical engineer or both you must see this following point.\n\n3.Software &amp; Accessories\nWe were able to test the latest version of Samsung's Magician software now that the drives are actually on the market. The new 860 series and the 850 non-Pro/EVO from China are now supported. They also work with Rapid Mode, which is Samsung's DRAM cache algorithm that increases performance and reduces wear on the flash.\n\n4.Packaging (Check pics included in the review)\nCan you guess what Samsung's tagline is for the 860 EVO? ""The SSD That Makes A Difference"" is emblazoned on both the front and back of the package. The warranty on the retail package. Samsung doesn't mention performance, endurance, or any other metric you might use in a retail store to compare this product to the one next to it.\n",0,,,,,,,,

But I wont lie like 10x speed,"\n I rated 5 stars. This shows I am satisfied with the product. However I like to write few things here being an Video editor and Designer.\nBefore 2 years i purchased Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.70 GHz 8gb ram. After an year I added another 8gb ram. Things helped a little while working with premiere pro or photoshop. Still lightroom took massive 30 or 40 seconds to load. Also Premiere got hanged for 3-5 seconds many times during color grading (not crash). Also crashed many times while working on text layers. Now after 2.5 hard years I just replaced inbuilt 2 TB HDD with this newly bought 1TB Samsung 860 EVO. Now let me write the differences happened.\n\nPros:\nBoot time just 5 -8 seconds. Installed 2021 version of Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Blender 3D, After effects, etc., Lightroom opens so quickly now which is a masiive surprise. Premiere pro no hang at all. However windows crashed 3 times which i assume as software issue. Photoshop 2021 also comfortable to open and work when premiere pro is rendering a HD video file. File transfer speed inside different drives is 100-150mbps normally (practially 100-150 not 300-400mbps). After this SSD purchase honestly I admit my tensions were reduced so much while working on video editing. with 10K investment, I would say this is also a Health Investment for me (lol) as I am free now of from unwanted tensions.\n\nCons:\nCons is really not a cons at all. Just want to remind some facts and say don't over expect everything on this SSD alone. Recently i transfered 8 tb of files from different external hard disks. Some i copied to system and moved. Others were USB 3.0 to USB 2.0 and 1 significantly 128gb SSD. Here comes my point. SSD to SSD means it must be top speed. Right?\nI copied 30 gb from system to 128 gb sandisk SSD. for this I used Sata to USB 2.0 cable as thats what I had. The average transfer speed was just 37 mbps. Though I still take the blame on USB 2.0 cable, things like this happens. Some peoples just blame their PC SSD blindly. USB cable and USB port also matters.\n\nSo for this reason, I always copy my video files to system SSD itself. 1 TB is very limited for guys who work multiple projects at same time. But considering the amount we spend on this SSD and how much it helps alone matters here.\nfor me its very fine to work 2 wedding projects at the same time. Everything is so cool with this SSD purchase.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Now SSD is ready for installation. Shutdown the notebook.\nOpened the back cover of the notebook. HDD was removed and SSD was installed in the place of HDD. Closed the back cover of notebook. Switched on the notebook and Windows 10 Booted from SSD. Using the notebook for last two days with SSD and speed of booting is improved and opening of the programs and browsing (Edge) is faster now with SSD.\nI selected Samsung SSD for cloning software and Data Migration tool is simple and easy to use.\nAs per the packing sticker, Net Content: SSD-1N, Manual &amp; SW CD-1N, Installation Guide-1N, Warranty Statement-1N. But Manual &amp; SW CD-1N was not in the box and is missing.

It shows great results on crystal disk mark with both default and real world performance test. I have also attached hdtune pro results . To tell you, most of the test on hd tune are read tests not write as it needs disk to be formatted with no partitions on it to be able to perform write tests. I decided not to turn on Automatic acoustic management as i was satisfied with the performance of this ssd. All these tests done are without any tweaking to the ssd.

Thought of upgrade my laptop itself and realized that I have to spent 60K for the latest one. So decided to give chance for my old laptop by upgrading it's RAM and HDD.\n\nSince it's an old laptop it doesn't have a m.2 or nvme SSD slot in its board. So bought this 2.5"" SSD which will perfectly fit in my 2.5"" inch SATA HDD slot. I was in doubt when I bought this whether it will work or not. Trust me this thing worked like a charm.!!! Now my laptop is superfast (as compared to my old HDD) and windows 10 boots up in few seconds. And also launching apps accessing huge files became much much faster. Now I feel like it's a new laptop.!!!\n\nOnly problem was how to clone my old HDD and OS without loosing license and data. But crucial site has all the support you need. They have step by step videos to install and upgrade your old laptop. I am not a laptop mechanic, still am able to replace my HDD myself (see the pics). They have cloning software which is free for us(there are third-party sw which does the cloning but we have to pay). Very easy to upgrade by following those docs/videos.\n\nExtremely happy for this purchase. Saved my 50K (not required to buy new laptop)\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have a old laptop with slow HDD and you don't have plan to buy new laptop or looking for cheap solution, then go for this SSD.\n",0,,,,,,,,

I'll share with you how my journey buying this SSD was and what I learnt and what you should know.\n\nMX500 is not the most budget-friendly and entry-level SSD out there (there is WD Green, Crucial BX500, Kingston A400 and some others) but I would say it's excellent for the price. Before the MX500, I had purchased its younger sibling, BX500, and I noticed+learnt a couple of things with that.\n1. Similar transfer speeds at around 390 MB/s\n2. SLC caching (16 GB for 240 GB variant, 32 GB for 480 GB variant and so on). What it means is that after writing 16 GB, 32 GB and so on, write speed would drop significantly because instead of writing to the SLC cache of the drive, data would be written directly to the TLC. SLC is way faster than TLC (around 400 MB/s write to the drive while using SLC cache and around 50-80 MB/s once SLC cache is full).\nThis SLC cache varies from SSD to SSD and can be seen even on premium SSDs that cost 20k-30k (it brings down the cost, otherwise those drives would cost over a lakh or something!)\nAlso, the BX500 had a 3-year warranty (MX500 has a 5-year warranty) and lower TBW (Terabytes Written) rating than the MX500. So I returned my BX500 because the performance was an issue and chose to go with MX500.\n\nPerformance of the MX500 is superb. I have it hooked to my MacBook Air using a Transcend StoreJet SATA to USB adaptor thingy just like I did with the BX500. I transferred around 80 GB data from my MacBook to the MX500, and it moved files and folders at about 350 MB/s to the drive throughout the transfer, with speed drop to around 150 MB/s 5-6 times for 3-4 seconds each time (that was because it was moving tiny files and folders). Crucial says that the MX500 has a Dynamic Write Acceleration on their website. Well, it clearly works!\n\nSo should you buy an MX500? It depends. If you are planning to buy an SSD that will probably last for years, if you plan to write lots of data to the drive, if you need an SSD as a scratch disk (for photo and video editing) or if you want an SSD that's good but costs less than the Samsung SSDs, then go for MX500. I'm building a PC in a couple of weeks and I'll use the MX500 as the boot device in that.\nHowever, if you have an old laptop that is extremely slow and takes forever to start, maybe you have desktop with some old, failing hard drive and you are looking for an SSD, and you are not a heavy user (that is you'll browse the web, write emails and do stuff like that), then save some money (if you wish) and go for the BX500.\n\nAbout the delivery of the product, I got an empty box when I ordered the MX500 from Amazon. Once I got it and saw that the item was missing, I brought it to Amazon's notice, and they said they would take two days to conduct an investigation. However, when I called the next day, I got to know that they concluded that I could get a replacement or a refund. The process for replacement wasn't very smooth (it took about a week to get a replacement unit), but in the end, I got the product, and the product is pretty much excellent like I had expected, hence the five stars.\n\nAnother important thing that I want to mention is that the MRP in the box of the 500 GB variant of the MX500 is Rs 8,400 (screenshot attached) and at the time of writing this review on 30 June 2020, there are a couple of sellers on Amazon named ""Cart2India Online"" and ""Cart2India SLP"" who are selling the product at twice the price (Rs 14,358). There are some other sellers also who list the MRP as Rs 9,000 or 10,000 and then say they are providing a discount of Rs 4,000 or Rs 5,000 when in fact, they are only offering a discount of Rs 2,500 or something. I especially saw this with the seller ""Gadget Buggy"". Basically, AVOID THESE SELLERS and buy from Appario Retail Private Ltd or the other Fulfilled By Amazon sellers.\n",0,,,,,,,,

After replacing HDD with Crucial SSD, I really surprised to notice that how an SSD can change your laptop speed. Earlier, my laptop was taking around 02 minutes to boot up and now it is reduced to 25 seconds. If, I open an application like MS office or Excel, it was taking too much time around 1.34 minutes, I needed to wait for that which made me fade up and now, you just need to click and applications are popping out immediately. Really.... Very happy.\n\nTip: If you are planning to buy a upgrade RAM to improve your laptop speed, first you go for SSD then think of upgrading RAM. Because, I did the same and want to tell you that whatever improvement I noticed in upgrading SSD from HDD, I have not seen any noticeable improvement by upgrading RAM, although it also works fine in dual channel..\n",0,,,,,,,,

I installed fresh windows 10 in around 12 minutes, same install process would take around 30 minutes in HDD. Now I'm able to login windows in just under 30 seconds, with my old HDD login would take around 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nNow I can carry my Lenovo yoga laptop without worrying about damaging the HDD.\n\nThis SSD made in Malaysia. Not sure about the 5 years warranty hope nothing bad happens.\n\nProfessional and heavy users must install the Crucial Stroage Executive software to get more out of this SSD.\n",0,,,,,,,,

The price just before the sale was Rs 2,696/- but on sale, it had a lightning deal of 2,499/- and I got 10% Rs 250 additional discount for HDFC Card. In Short, I got the SSD for Rs 2249/-.\nThis SSD is worth every penny. I have a Lenovo Ideapad 320-15IKB (Type 81BG, 81BT) with basic configuration ( i5 8th gen, 8GB ram and 1TB 5400 rpm HDD). After 2 years of use, the laptop became super slow, boot time was around two minutes and it used to get stuck very often (couldn't open more than 4-5 tabs in chrome at one go). Tried every tweak youtube videos had to offer but there was no visible performance improvement. Somebody suggested to buy an SSD ( I didn't wanted to spend much on it honestly ). After searching and reading comments I finally decided to go for this one. Below is my view of this product to help you decide to make an informed choice if you wish to get one:\n1. Boot time on my machine is less than 12 seconds\n2. MS office opens as soon as you click on a file (haven't seen taking more than 3 seconds)\n3. Chrome is never stuck (can open 10-12 tabs, never tried more than that but pretty sure it can handle more)\n4. Significant time reduction in transferring a file from Pendrive, hard drive, phone\n5. 2.2k for a 240gb SSD is the best deal, can't say about the coming times as technology improves but this is the best deal you can get for now\n6. Some people have written non-satisfactory reviews on this (and they have compared it with Samsung Evo, let me tell you, I am sure that is among the best SSD available, but it comes at double the price with maybe 20% extra performance, you can do the math to figure out which is a better option when it comes to value buy)\n7. Honest opinion: If you are someone looking for an SSD that offers decent performance (8-10x better than 5400rpm HDD), and don't wanna spend too much on it then this is a product for you.\n8. And lastly, enable ""Momentum Cache"" by downloading Crucial Storage Executive which will enhance your speed upto 6GBps. (Picture 1 is without enabling Momentum Cache facility and Picture 2 is using Momentum Cache facility.)\n\nI hope this review helps you in making an informed decision on buying an SSD.\nThank you.\n",0,,,,,,,,

Fill the SSD only to its 80-85% capacity.\n\nSpoiler: You get only 223gb practically ( was expecting around 230-235 gb).\n\n*Note: before purchasing please check your support ed SATA version(mine was sata3 600).

Also ordered a SATA to USB cable from PIBOX - Amazon's choice again. The Crucial drive could not be recognized by my Laptop and it came up with the message that the USB device malfunctioned even after I used Disk Management to give it a drive path and a volume label. So immediately asked for a replacement which arrived the next day. Luckily this SSD worked along with the PIOBOX cable and I could give it a drive path after which it got recognized by my laptop - see photo. Since the first SSD failed I fixed a 1TB Toshiba HDD - which I had ordered sometime ago - on to my PC. And it is functioning smoothly just like the other Toshiba HDD that stores all my data. Reserving my Crucial SSD for future use. Moral of the story - avoid Seagate at all costs, Toshiba is a better option and verdict on Crucial SSD is reserved for now.\n",0,,,,,,,,
